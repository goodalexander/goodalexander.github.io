## Minimum Viable Execution

I want to get full tactical about what minimum viable execution of firing myself actually means.

Most systems break apart because we do not even realize they’re running. You stop logging your workout. And progressive overload becomes more of a theory, something you have in the back of your mind. Before disappearing entirely. 

My mentor, and one of the best portfolio managers I know (shout out JDP) constantly emphasizes “process over outcome”. Tracking process is crucial to strong systems. 

My concept of minimum viable execution has three parts:
1. It should be as minimal as possible 
2. It is non negotiable
3. I am committing to 100% compliance to it for 6 months (until Jan 5 2024)

## Diet

I am ripping off and modifying Bryan Johnson’s diet with the inclusion of dairy and ramping caffeine a bit via matcha powder. Why? It works. It’s been in production for 3 months now and I’m happy with the results - body fat is moving down, strength and speed are at highs, and I’m not hungry despite calorie restriction (I do 2050 daily) and quitting caffeine 

### Morning shake:
* 8 oz water
* 1 tablespoon spirulina
* 2 scoops Vital Protein Collagen Peptides
* 2 teaspoons ceylon cinnamon
* 1 scoop whey protein 
* 1 tablespoon raw cacao
* 2 tsp matcha powder 

### Super Veggie
* 1 cup lentils
* 2 cups broccoli 
* 1 cup cauliflower
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp paprika
* Juice of 1 lemon 
* ½ oz raw almonds  

### Protein Assortment
* High protein tofu or Quorn (mycoprotein)
* Air fried green banana + fresh root vegetables
* Kimchi 
* Seasonal vegetable / fruit additions – ideally in season/ rotating 

### Berry/ Nut Shake
* Mixed berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries) - frozen
* Almonds, walnuts 
* Kefir or greek yogurt (prefer Kefir)
* Matcha powder, cinnamon, cocoa powder

### Supplements (in progress)

Morning:
* turmeric curcumin 500 mg
* ginger 1.1g
* creatine 5g
* b complex
* garlic 350 mg

* ashwaganda 200 mg 

Evening pill pack:
* Taurine (500mg)
* flaxseed oil (1.3g)
* creatine (2.5g)
* ginger (1.15g)

### Meals with friends:
* Always order salad, veggies, or the healthiest thing on the menu (will eat meat if that’s what it means)
* If eating with a friend that day do not consume berry/ nut shake as that’s close to 700 calories. Instead consume 2 scoop of protein w water 

### Feeding Window
* Feeding window (6:30 AM - 1 PM) 
* unless meal with friends (kept to minimum) - try to schedule early 

## Exercise

The agreements here -
1. Periodically consult a personal trainer for advice (every 2 months) to ensure all forms are correct.
2. Train strength, HRV and V02 max higher.
3. Listen to The Economist, Financial Times, or industry (AI) podcasts during my workouts to avoid dead time which is usually over 1 hour daily.
 
I do not agree with the overall principle Bryan Johnson advocates of training the same muscles every day as that seems to contradict most peer reviewed literature / resting time so have had to do this custom.

## Firing Myself

The idea of firing yourself is essentially using AI augmentation to improve decision making by using the absolute minimum amount of judgment on a daily/weekly basis. I wrote about this in my last post with a detailed roadmap for building out software tools to augment this. For this to work effectively you need A] large amounts of regularly uploaded qualitative context B] quantitative KPIs that suggest how well things are moving forward. AI tools can only make high quality decisions on your behalf if they’re armed with full context. 

### Daily processes:
* 9:40 AM - review morning trading execution, ensure risk systems have worked 
* 9:45-10 AM: Prepare for stand up via taking yesterday’s tasks/ pomodoros/ etc as well as Milestone document and running through GPT4  
* 10 AM: morning stand up notes uploaded to Database. Morning stand up should always state what milestones are being worked
* 11 AM is the workout / target finish eating by 1 PM 
* 8 PM: notes uploaded to database summarizing days work. KPI sheets updated (qualitative assessment script is run - which is a GPT4 powered questionnaire). 
* 8-8:30 PM Actively do leisure activities (could be calling friends randomly, reading online garbage, watching funny videos, watching TV, playing video games) 
* All work done via Pomodoros (25 min blocks w 5 min breaks) where content of Pomodoros is logged to the database 

### Weekly processes (Sunday)
* 1-2 hours spent writing weekly reviewing past week and
* Updating Sprint Plan / Milestone Document
* Grocery shopping / meal prep (lentil dish is bulk preparation) 
* 2-3 hours of feature implementation of software features to improve overall systems architecture
* Maid every other week 

## Some Important Conceptual Points

I share a goal of radical life extension with Bryan Johnson, but because I lack his financial resources I view health as a constraint instead of the primary optimization function. That is to say - building a valuable company is more likely to unlock cutting edge health-tech than working out. However, not dying or killing yourself to build said company also makes sense.  

Furthermore - it’s important to avoid “analysis paralysis” - and the tracking here I try and keep very minimal. For example, I don’t actually track my diet or exercise (like logging all my weight), I just follow the Blueprint perfectly. When appropriate I'll have coaches change the diet / exercise params. For my daily KPI updates, the vast majority of them are automated. 

I devote my brain damage capacity to analyzing professional workflows, writing code and building a company. 

## Flexibility

With all this said, my goal is 100% compliance.

I want to outline actively what happens if 
1. KPIs don’t get updated 
2. stand ups are missed 
3. workouts / diet adherence drops 
4. Pomodoros don’t get updated / done 
5. Other MVEs not reached

In the event that I'm unable to maintain the outlined routines and KPIs, I will invoke a 'manual override' by enlisting the help of personal coaches or compliance experts. This will ensure adherence to the process, or the revision of the process until it becomes manageable. Health is a non-negotiable aspect, and so irrespective of other setbacks, the health plan will be continually executed. While I don't anticipate this situation, I want to make it clear that failure isn't an option. Should there be a slip, it merely indicates that it's time to call in the professionals

I think it’s important to recognize that executing this plan will likely severely hinder or lower the quality of my personal relationships, and that’s something I’m prepared to accept (and already have hah!). I won’t be able to fully complete every workout or commit to doing a specified number of Pomodoros - but at least a vast majority of this, I can do every day. And I’m emotionally bought into ensuring baseline execution. Obviously, I don’t encourage you to do any of this. This is just something I feel I need to do. It will be lonely. 

But over time I hope to attract like minded people and a community around my authentic thoughts which I think will make this less lonely over time. Sorry in advance, friends.
