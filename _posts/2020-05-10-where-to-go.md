summary:    Inputs drive outputs, which begs the question - what is the desired output and what is the correct input?

I want to be clear with myself about what matters, where I am right now, and what I need to do to get where I want to go.

** What matters to me? 

First - I believe that progress, at the human genome level, is attainable within our lifetime. The rapid acceleration of Moore's law with regards to sequencing, exponentially improving compute power and definitive early traction in genomics medicine makes me believe that the old paradigm of humanity will be thrown out the window within the next 100 years. My father who is a cancer doctor highlighted how spit swab testing can drastically improve patient outcomes for prostate treatment -- just as an example. The severe collaboration internationally with regards to human testing and COVID19 will likely supercharge genomics research. 

The decline and fall of the Catholic Church, and the rise of the Chinese Communist Party remove the major obstacle to genomic progress in the past. The combination of what is - in essence - a new Cold War, combined with a decline fo moral qualms about "playing God" - should supercharge genomics research and development for decades to come. 

I am 31 years old currently, and think it is -- essentially a coin flip that I'll live long enough to access the fruits of genomic technology. This is a tragedy - as I fundamentally enjoy being alive. I love reading books, going to the beach, interacting with friends and talking to my brother. These experiences are not justified in some sort of utility value. There are also terrible things like losing close friends, experiencing professional failure, coming to terms with injury. But both the good and the bad comprise my life - which I view as having an inherent value separate from its utility. The idea of death seems to be a profound tragedy - almost an insult to the wild coincidence of being created in such a vast universe. 

Had I been born 100 years ago, the dominant strategy to confront death would be a mix of mindfulness, religion and family rearing. To confront one's own death and accept it would be the utmost objective, and secondarily to continue one's essence through children would matter substantially too. 

For the first time in human history, the possibility of avoiding death seems feasible. Given that I have no profoundly strong beliefs, other than that life itself is worth preserving, and that injury and decay make life less enjoyable - it seems fairly clear that the purpose of my life is - in fact, attempting to avoid death. The fact that it is profoundly unlikely to succeed doesn't seem to matter much, as any perceived feasibility imparts a moral obligation in my mind. 

Thus - what matters to me? Catalyzing the technology to solve death. 

** Where I am right now / how did I get here?

I am in a vulnerable place right now, but finally beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Several years ago, I left my start-up - Perpetua - in a mutual decision. We started an advertising technology company that started out selling data to hedge funds. The original reason I wanted to get involved in advertising was that I thought it was a lens to better understand the real time economic underpinnings of our society. I was working at a hedge fund and using ads to trade stocks quite profitably. This traction combined with my co-founder's excellent track record helped us convince investors to give us $6 million within 1 week of incorporating the company. We raised another $4 million in a follow on round. I didn't see how abstract my vision was because other hedge funds bought into the idea that they shouldn't be trading Facebook stock if they had no idea how well Facebook's ads worked. The money was flowing in. "It is working, it is simple, it is obvious, but it is contrarian" - I told myself. 

Over time, it became clear that my ideas about using advertising data to trade securities wasn't as obvious as I thought. It was contrarian for a reason. 

Ultimately if you're running a hyper growth start up you need to be 100% clear about what you're doing. In our case, we were helping businesses grow on Amazon. We built kick ass software to help people do it that made the alpha from trading stocks based on advertising data look like a joke. Someone using our software could expect a 300-400% IRR on investment. Ad platforms would let you light money on fire - and indeed - that is the default setting on Google, Facebook and Amazon's ad platforms. If you get into the complex cockpits these ad behemoths have built without knowing what you're doing, you tend to crash your plane. Perpetua built self driving ad software that worked and stopped advertising "crashes" on a regular basis. 

Given the hyper growth of Amazon ads and how important it was to customers, it was just confusing and weird to tell employees or customers we made a substantial portion of our profits selling data to hedge funds. This became even stranger as we began signing institutional accounts -- the possibility of a publicly traded company using our software wasn't something I'd thought of or planned for when I started the company. But it was becoming a reality. We decided to silo the trading business entirely with me. Ultimately, I wasn't really excited about building ad software - I was excited about using the outputs to understand society and reality. But it was an excitement I couldn't share -- lest we distract our product team, or confuse or alienate our clients. 

The last conversation we wanted to have with a client was, "Sorry about your ads doing poorly, but don't feel too bad because our hedge fund clients made a fortune shorting your stock." It was hard to look at employees with a straight face and say our mission was helping small businesses when we were making more than 1/2 our money selling data to one of the world's most notorious and controversial hedge funds. In hindsight, this should have been predictable. The realization was painful. Leaving your start up is like getting a divorce and losing custody of your children. The fact that it needs to be done doesn't make it any less shitty for anyone involved. 

Since leaving my start up I've been dealing with rather severe health issues that might have resulted from a decade of working on Wall Street around the clock and the stress of "moving fast and breaking things". I had severe liver issues and had to quit drinking. It was quite alarming discovering a month after quitting booze that I'd been addicted -- not mentally, but physically. I also developed a severe knee injury playing squash. I used to be known for how fit I was, and now was unable to exercise. 

I dedicated myself to systematic trading until September of last year. This worked reasonably well - insofar as the systematic strategies I designed worked and made money. I collaborated with some people improving them, and life went by in a blur. I'd wake up covered in sweat and aching, and could only work 2-3 hours a day. I had headaches constantly. I gained weight, unused to being unable to exercise like I did in my 20s. 

My old company was succeeding strongly without me, my friends were all getting promoted to Managing Director at banks. One friend who I'd bought sushi for because he had no money bootstrapping his start up, was now worth $50 million and on the cover of major publications. My patient girlfriend stayed with me through the whole ordeal, which I'm eternally grateful for -- but a year ago I couldn't stop thinking how I needed to "make things worth her while". I was wracked with guilt for existing. I felt like I needed to justify all the damage I'd done to myself and those around me with more success. I needed to "make it all back". But when I started working I got crippling fatigue. 

I became incredibly depressed. About 1 year ago - despite what I wrote about valuing life, I began seriously contemplated if I wanted to go on living. 

Basically, shit got real.

My brother shared with me a book that changed my life, called "Feeling Good". The premise of the book is that if you write down your negative thoughts and classify them as untrue and/or harmful, you'll feel better over time. It sounds ridiculously simple, and it is, but it worked for me. I got less depressed and tearing myself up, which I suspect allowed my body to finally heal. I still don't feel amazing, but I feel okay. I didn't used to believe that health problems could be psychosomatic, but now I do. 

By this September, I realized I needed to elevate my game. My trading mentor
