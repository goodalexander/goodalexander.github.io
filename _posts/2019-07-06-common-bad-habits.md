Our subscription based economy has put enormous financial incentive into making us slaves to our bad habits. Netflix, Facebook, Video Games, pornography, sugar, snacking, junk news, checking investment accounts or stock tickers. It sounds obvious, but the people who have made deliberately addictive products do not have our well being in mind. 

Any app that improves your life permanently - such as e-harmony, which finds you a long term match - will not do nearly as well financially as one which improves your life temporarily, and repeatedly. Such as Tinder. If your product is so useful and good that people stop needing it, then you will churn your most valuable users away. 

People often quit bad habits only to re-start them. Many times, I have tried to quit all my bad habits at once. I’ve succeeded, but then relapsed when something went wrong with my health. For example, I got mono (or some kind of virus) that made me fatigued all the time and virtually unable to do anything. I ended up falling into old bad habits of playing video games because it was one of the only things I found tolerable at the time.

Then, once I slowly started getting better - I had an old bad habit again.  Bad habits are called “bad” because they generate powerful dopamine responses, and also are maladaptive to our modern lives. This is why I don’t view caffeine as a bad habit. I actually think caffeine is very positive for our modern lives because the nature of our work requires longer stretches of alertness than our ancestors required. I do think it’s worth reflecting if things are actually worth quitting. 

The reason why the ‘addiction’ economy is so powerful, is because our lives have inevitably large numbers of triggers that get us back on the dopamine treadmill. Simply seeing the treadmill and acknowledging that it exists is not enough. I’ve known about it my entire adult life. I’ve written about it, talked to others about it. Doesn’t matter. As soon as I had mono, I wanted to play video gams because I felt terrible and wanted to feel better. 

Thus, it’s the inability to make ourselves feel better that leads to relapse. 

Simply knowing this doesn’t matter either. I’ve read books like the Happiness Advantage and am bombarded by the same centi-millionaires/ billionaires  advocating meditation as everyone else. By the way - very few of them actually meditate. They’re just virtue signaling. Skyrocketing wealth inequality and the prevalence of social media makes virtue signaling more important. If all the wealthy people actually are doing what they’re doing because they’re just on a personal path to enlightenment, the general populace is on balance less likely to persecute them or tax them. 

Many of these virtue signalers get much wealthier by getting superior business deal flow because of their “wise man” status. Many entrepreneurs and successful executives are pretty unhappy people, constantly dealing with the dopamine treadmill and are quietly desperate for help. I know this because I started a venture backed company and spoke with many other people who did the same and felt this way. The enormous wealth of Tim Ferriss and Naval Ravikant due to their guru status for Sillicon Valley is testament to how desperate many entrepreneurs are to get professional or semi professional help in a way that doesn’t make them look weak. They’ll give away $2 million chunks of equity for therapy. 

When I worked at Palantir, CEOS of big fortune 500 companies loved meeting with Palantir’s CEO not because we had the best software, but because he had a rich background in philosophy. They felt lost in life just like the rest of us and would make time in their day for a semi-spiritual person who practiced Qi Gong and could talk for hours about Heidegger and pursuit of meaning in the face of death. 

Unfortunately, the fact that the Virtue Signalers are simply economically rational actors means that they’re incentivized to do the same thing as the addiction economy. Tim Ferriss wants to sell the incremental book. Naval Ravikant wants the incremental twitter follower. Alex Karp wants the next deal to close. They ultimately want you dependent on their next nugget of wisdom, not self sufficient. For all the aestheticism on tap, you’ll likely find it mysteriously shut off if the deal doesn’t close or there aren’t advisor shares dispensed. The value of the Guru Status isn’t nearly as enticing if you can get a distilled version of their wisdom in an easy to read format that doesn’t require giving them advisor shares. 

Even if these capitalist wise men do provide a distilled version of their wisdom, it will be just like a freemium SAAS model with multiple up-sells. The hyper premium version most likely will involve giving up a board seat and 50 bps of equity. 

I really dislike the transactional nature of friendships that arises from that type of lifestyle. But that’s a discussion for another time. 

Long story short - we don’t really have anywhere to turn. People who give you advice about breaking free from the addiction economy are self serving to the point where you can’t really trust them. Most of the prolific people have indexed high on google because they have a high LTV selling their product - which means that their advice is just another addictive thing they’re trying to sell you 

I didn’t write all this to say “Well that’s it, there is no solution so we should just move on and accept all our addictions though”. I simply wanted to make a fundamental axiom:

You can’t trust anybody except yourself when it comes to quitting addictions. 

So in that vein, I wanted to hypothesize or attempt to answer the question, “How can I quit all my bad habits in a sustainable way?”

To address that — I’d start with the question, “What events are likely to break any system that I have?”

For me the answer to this is:
1. Seriously negative economic events, such as losing a large amount of money investing
2. Negative health events such as getting mono, or hurting your knee
3. Negative relationship events such as fights with girlfriend etc 

Specifically - I believe that sleep is a big part of all three of these. During fights, during large investing drawdowns, and during negative health periods — all three have a lack of sleep regularity in common. Granted - it’s quite difficult to sleep soundly during these periods for a reason — but the lack of sleep, or its lack of regularity is what most accurately predicts getting into bad habits. 

Netflix binges happen at weird hours, as do video games, random eating etc. 

At which point the question is: is there a set of behaviors that can reliably generate sound sleep for me?

The answer is yes. First — reading boring financial books makes me tired. Second, I am more tired after having gone swimming. 

Thus - in tandem with breaking bad habits, the argument would be to proactively take on habits likely to generate good sleep. Rather than being overly aggressive on the ‘elimination side’, being aggressive on good sleep is probably a better call because it enhances rationality and will power which are key ingredients in good decision making. I think having some kind of non addictive sleep aid on hand is a good idea just in case I cannot fall asleep, and that getting in a habit of napping is a bad idea. 

Secondly — I believe there is another set of habits that has to do with nervous energy, or the unpleasantness of the task at hand. I don’t think these have as much to do with sleep. For example, when I am writing very mundane code or doing something I don’t enjoy- I spend a lot of time flipping to Twitter, or Reddit, or CNBC — with the vague explanation that I am somehow improving my situational awareness. 

The reason why this habit is so pernicious is that there is *some benefit* from these activities. Knowing that the Mexican Peso is devaluing because of a minister leaving the government certainly helps me make good intraday trading decisions. But - at some level, that’s making an implicit argument in favor of making intraday trading decisions at all. Knowing the percentage likelihood the market places on Donald Trump getting impeached is, at some level good. 

In the past, I have made these decisions profitably and had to constantly be plugged in to financial news. But it’s worth noting that during those periods I wrote very small amounts of code, and didn’t really progress in my craft and did not formulate longer term trade ideas.

Finally re: cryptocurrencies, there are strong backtested patterns that argue panic selling or panic buying is actually a good idea. Because I don’t have systems built out that trade automatically in these events, there’s an innate desire to check price feeds. 

I view this set of habits as similar to sugar consumption. It not only feels good to have sugar, it also makes you more alert and productive in the near term. Except, over the long run - you become dependent on it, and it no longer has the same effect. You just become a person who eats a lot of sugar.

I *do not think* that I could completely unplug from markets or the news cycle. And I do believe that in the case of financial news, price feeds etc - I need to replace them with something more thoughtful. Specifically, at the country club I’m a member of there’s the financial Times. I believe making time to read the FT would be a much better use of time than randomly going to CNBC. I actually think being *proactive* about a weekly write up of what’s going on in market combined with the daily FT (ideally with note taking) would remove a lot of my negative feelings about financial news consumption.

Thus - in the analogy, moving my carbs to whole grain carbs. I don’t want to quit carbs — but I want to up the quality and duration of my carbs. 

The meta here is that bad habits are best contextualized as “most similar to heroin” i.e something you just should quit regardless because there’s no amount of heroin that’s the right amount, or stuff that’s closer to sugar. Sugar habits need substitutes because they exist for a reason.

Thus key takeaways:
1. Regulating my sleep is the all important ingredient to cutting back on extremely bad habits. I have no problem quitting bad habits for even an extended period, but have an issue with relapsing - which almost always occurs during bad times, during bad sleep cycles. and As such, I’m going to make time to swim and read boring financial stuff before sleep and turn that into a hard core, non negotiable habit rather than focusing on *not* doing 20 different things
2. Bad habits that serve a purpose (i.e. random news consumption) are like simple carbs that certainly could be done away w entirely — but that wouldn’t be easy because there’s a real justification for them. The justification is being informed and having good risk Mgmt around investing, so placing more focus on that explicitly and increasing the *quality and quantity* of information is the best way to actually productively quit the bad habit of excessive news consumption 

To keep myself accountable I’ll post this and check back in within a week to see how it’s going.
