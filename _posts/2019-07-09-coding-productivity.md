summary:    When you don't want to do a soul crushing sprint plan, and just want to put headphones on and break things, what are the best principles to operate?

When trying to maximize my coding output I always find myself considering either:

1) Writing down every task in advance, similar to a sprint plan -- and methodically going through each task like I'd expect an employee to
2) Just putting my head down and shipping it

Method 2 is faster and more enjoyable, but then I realize I have 20 open ipython notebooks and the quality of my code went down.
Then I end up having to debug it. I do understand the argument that project planners make (annoyingly) that "Slow is fast".

At the same time -- I believe there's a better middle ground. Putting your head down and shipping it is just so much more enjoyable
that it's much more sustainable if you're actually good at what you're doing. It also makes you feel less like a corporate drone which
is good for creativity and self image, which actually influences long term productivity.

Thus -- I'm creating a list of 10 principles to improve the overall long term quality of code that is not at all planned.

I am referring to the state of NOT doing project planning but also being super productive as "Chaos Mode".

I believe there's a better way to approach Chaos Mode -- and if you do it thoughtfully it works out better than Agile development.

I think if you screw it up you get a 90% drop off vs agile, but if you do it right you get a 40% improvement. So it's asymettric downside - 
and over time, I do think I'd rather bet money on planners for this reason. But as a chaotic individual who hates structure, I think it's worth
figuring out how to maximize output given natural preferences. So here goes:

## Max productivity Chaos Mode.

1. Plain english function titles - make sure that your functions are named in a way that explains what they are doing so that you don't have to go through the code in order to figure them out
2. Commit repeated functions relentlessly. If you have a scrapign methodology you're constantly re-writing, you might feel like you're faster the 10th time you do it, but you're actually pathetically slow. If you do something repeatedly, spend the extra time and add it to the utilities function library.
3. 3 notebook MAX. 1 Notebook for what you're working on now, 1 for production stuff such as graphs and research, 1 for exploration and hacks. This is a forced focus mechanism that's easy to monitory. The temptation to have 20 notebooks of uncommitted code feels fairly common among data science types. I'm a bit ashamed of my tendency to do this.
4. Constant stream of coding or electronic music. You might work slightly more slowly on average but I find less likely to get distracted over time because music is inherently enjoyable.
5. Keep imessage on your phone, remove from dock. Uninstall Facebook / messenger apps on your desktop. Imessage is a constant interrupt, and if you're coding it will tank your productivity 
6. Chaos only works with monolithic project focus. You can be unfocused and not do task management, but you're storing everything in RAM. That's efficient and fast but gets dumb and slow when your RAM fills up and you don't remember where anything is. Pragmatically this means 1 project at a time when you're in chaos mode.
7. Visually audit data randomly / make time to play with outputs to ensure quality. Too often I've found that a data source has broken down etc too late. Sure you can write tons of checks to prevent this -- but random testing gives new ideas and checks break down too. A good example is I was relying on an interest rate timeseries that was updating and wasn't changing because the interest rate had been actually discontinued entirely at the central bank. My 'check' was working but wasn't picking up something fundamental.
8. Don't eat - just drink caffeine. I find that I'm far scrappier and high energy when I'm loaded on caffeine on an empty stomach rather than filled with food and needing to break focus to go to the bathroom etc.
9. Sleep. Per my previous post. 
10. Don't collaborate in this mode. There's no possible way you'll be able to convey state across all the random things to someone. It's best to just hardcore hack somethign, stand it up and then show it to someone after for improvement.
