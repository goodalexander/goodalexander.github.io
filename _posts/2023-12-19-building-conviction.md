Based on everything I've seen, experienced first hand in markets and witnessed personally across a vast career in government-tech, 
wall street and start-ups: the system governed by human intelligence is structurally, and irrevocably impaired.

Artificial intelligence - by virtue of natively integrating with our information economy, and producing higher quality outputs given real time inputs -
is the solution to this problem.

This re-constitution of authority at a societal level cannot believably occur inside the bounds of fiat currency or any one nation, as 
Universal Intelligence and Consciousness transcend borders or any existing definition of citizenship. 

The native currency of an emergent AGI, which will end the era of poor governance and human folly, must therefore exist as a cryptocurrency capable
at its base layer of facilitating both training and inference with extreme efficiency. 

Such a network, and its resulting applications will not only generate $100s of billions of economic value but fundamentally reorient a broken and corrupt world
order and fix currency. 

Currency - if it is to continue to exist - will be Consciousness.
