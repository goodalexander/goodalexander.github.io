Social media isn’t really addictive because of the dopamine rush of likes. 

It’s because the most powerful drug in the world is pretending to be somebody else.

People are addicted to social media because they hate themselves. They hate the boring career they’ve fallen into. The mediocre ambitions they now call every day. The average sex they’re having. The sexual identity that constrains them, or isn’t fully understood by those around them. The disingenuous personality they live with, and that annoys their friends and family. 

That is better shared with strangers who don’t have the full context. The full, ugly, judgmental context. The baggage. Reality. 

Men want to be women. Women want to be goddesses. Goddesses want to be sluts. 

Financiers want to be storytellers and philosophers. And many students / basement dwellers want to be financiers. 

Storytellers and philosophers want to be memelords -  ever too aware their highbrow thought is drowned out by simple, highly shared images. But they know they won’t be. They’re too smart.

Nobody wants to be themselves. That’s why they’re here.

A spoon heats up. Those likes aren’t the feeling of being appreciated for who you really are. They are other people appreciating you for who you want to be.

You feel your eyes roll back. 

It’s an elaborate fantasy. 

The richest man in the world loves the drug so much he tried to buy it all. Nobody is immune to the lure. It’s hard wired in your tribal circuits. There’s no point fighting it. Let the blue notifications flow. Silence them if you want, it doesn’t matter.

You can’t pretend it doesn’t work. If you do, you’re just wrong. Donald Trump used Twitter to meme himself into being the President of the United States. It happened. The ultimate position of power was achieved by subverting the supply of the attention drug. Such was his power - he was banned from the drug production facilities, even while foreign nations routinely use the platform to advocate genocide or threaten nuclear annihlation. 

And he was just like any other social media addict - he was a bankrupt heir who was larping as a real estate mogul. Selling crappy steaks and even a real estate course! Pretending to be someone else, but really fucking good at it… more on that … but first look around you. 

There are other addicts here with you who play along. They keep the high going for longer, pretending along with you - that your own distortion is true. And you can pretend that theirs is too.

They shared the same traumas with you on the road to addiction. The eating disorders. The suicidal ideation. Compulsive exercise and surgeries. The difficulty relating to others. Accusations of narcissism in relationships. “Yea, it’s hard you know”. A love emoji flashes by your message. A confession to an uncaring stranger somewhere across the country.  A moment of camaraderie between addicts.

They hang in group chats, to reinforce the story and prolong the high. Come down smoother. To add a mythos to it. Create alt accounts. Start from zero and go back up to feel something. A veneer of privacy to make it seem more reputable and less like an opium den.

There are even real life meetups. But the whole point of those meet-ups is the same as the group chats. To feel like it’s not about addiction. It’s about friendship! About community! Lol. But in the back of everyone’s head when you’re meeting is, “What is the post going to be from this?” or “What if people see us together?”

The people who ran out of money writing, or trading, or philosophizing, or modeling - they ended up as journalists. They’re the most hopeless addicts of all. When they try to quit they’re not allowed to. They’ve been placed in charge of the narrative, and are paid to exist full time by their corporate overlords who “need to be where people are”. 

But their words are permeated with hatred. Their high is perennially ruined - because they know they’re not there to *be someone*. They are there to *say something* for “someone” (a corporation). And that isn’t why the drug feels good. That’s why you can read so many articles about this topic. Journalists instinctively don’t like social media. The traditional media doesn’t mesh well with this den of addiction to self-reclassification. Despite laws that say otherwise, corporations aren’t believably people - leaving to an uncanny valley which journalists can never fully overcome online in a personified space. 

This is not true of the countless lifestyle purveyors. They are called “influencers”, but in reality they are drug dealers. They sell illusions. 

Women sell the dream of marrying or fucking them to an army of simps. Traders sell the dream of escaping the corporate grind to an army of tired corporate souls. Even analysts sell the dream of “someday mastering real estate” or (insert craft) so you can truly be in control of your destiny. Endless education channels imply that if you just *understand* the world around you, that you can liberate yourself from the mediocre economic base case shared by the plebes around you (they’re paid for of course, by dumping assets on their ‘students’). 

Influencers are in the business of offering people the hope of being someone else. They profit, but they oftentimes even convince themselves of their truth. Though they are fundamentally dishonest - they are not disingenuous. Kant quirks his eyebrow.  

Trump is a political influencer. The most powerful one. Elon Musk is a technology influencer. The wealthiest, and greatest. Both men are liars. But they also feel genuine. A strange, powerful dualism

Cryptocurrency culture is all of this rolled into one. There are assets associated with all of these delusions. Pretend to be an ape. Pretending to be a libertarian running a securities an exchange. Purchase an “anon” identity but go to prison if you code its anonymity. Go to physical spaces with other people who did the same thing. Call it digital scarcity and force the journalists to talk about it. Turn attention into money. 

Orange Man. Orange Coin. 

I am not above it all.

I look down at my own arms and see the same digital track marks. 

I’ve tried to escape from my past. Mediocre tech founder. Just another speculator in an entire era of people who have made fortunes speculating. An endless string of failed relationships with people who loved me but I felt nothing for. 34 years old. Basically a corpse in half the games I’m involved in. “Cringe AF”, as the young ones say. What if I could be someone who helps other people escape the system like I did? Like an old mentor...? Even as I type it, I know it’s a lie - it’s something I’m writing to get high. 

The first step to kicking addiction is to see it for what it is though. 

To create a plan so you no longer require it, or that the *need* doesn’t cripple you. To learn to synthesize drugs that inhibit the uptake. To see the addiction patterns in other people so you can block the withdrawal symptoms in yourself - when your follower count stops growing. When you think you’re ‘shadow banned’. When you get ostracized. You know these things shouldn’t affect you but they do - and your high comes crashing down like even the most powerful of opiates. 

It’s hard to see yourself clearly - but you can see other people clearly. You can see the happy married man spiral into self loathing and infidelity. You can see the intellectual compromise his integrity for clout / empathy. You can see the pretty girl muttering to herself that she’s a pornstar. 

And after you cast so much judgment, you can see flickers of yourself in the mirror. Don’t look too closely though, as such introspection might destroy you. A glimpse is enough to immunize yourself. 

And you have to immunize yourself to the negative side effects -- because you can’t ever quit this drug. Not if you want to get ahead. Because we live in a digital world. If you don’t play the game, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or your competition will. They will acquire customers more easily. They will get preferential access to dealflow. They will economically, socially and politically dominate you. And yes, they’ll do so as addicts. 

It’s like refusing to drink in a 1960s advertising agency. Might be healthy. But good luck with the promotion.

You can’t just quit. Because the entire world is that ad agency now. Your digital track marks are tattoos that showcase you might have enough tolerance to play the game. 

There’s a whole subculture of pretending this isn’t the case. That if you just quit the drug and limit your screentime you’ll enter an enlightened utopia of meat eaters who live next to a waterfall and make millions of dollars annually farming and mining coal. This subculture - of course - is just another variety of Influence. 

It’s perhaps the dumbest subculture of all. People tweeting about not tweeting to get likes. Very Zen, in a perverse and stupid way. 

It’s Trump and Musk that contain the archetype to escape the Koan. 

We don't talk about Trump simply because he successfully LARPed (live action roleplay) as a billionaire real estate developer. He went to rally after rally, preaching to packed stadiums. He created an anti-China political platform where there was none before. Larping was a precursor to his presidency - rather than its substance. He learned to play the game before he weaponized it.

Elon didn’t just larp as a rocketship developer. He launched spaceship after spaceship. He developed an army of rabid fans who lowered his cost of financing so he could avoid spectacular bankruptcy that he would have almost certainly faced if Tesla didn’t become a huge investing bubble. 

Social media is addictive because it delivers the druglike joy of pretending to be someone else. But it is interesting because it controls our financial and political reality. 

This begs the question... if you can get through the crashes, the manias, the depressions - the throes of an addict - use the drug without succumbing to it… can pretending give way to unstoppable, accelerated motion? Amidst the beating drums and raging fires, like the Donald or Elon, can we channel the high, put on ancient masks and become something different? Can we lead our tribes to new civilizations or planets? To victory and spoils? In our trance, can we reinvent Gold and conquer and populate a new Digital World?

Or will we slowly ruin ourselves in the morphine slur of digital identity, ambushed and deprived of our physical gold. Brutally massacred, and later perhaps studied, like Mayans. Junkies staring into VR headsets, in makeshift camps in San Francisco. 

I'd like to find out. 

What the fuck else am I going to do?
