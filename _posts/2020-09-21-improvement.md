summary:    I want to cover some ways in which I am trying to improve 
---

I want to write some tactical improvments I am implementing to improve my life performance.

I want to start documenting what I'm going to do to address the deltas between what I'm getting and what I want. 

Strategies are higher order thoughts that should guide tactics. 

I want to assemble a list of questions to answer each day. Questions are more open ended than goals which I think is appropriate for a flexible investing mindset. 

Similar to the book "Checklist Manifesto" - I want to have a simple checklist that I maintain along with my trading checklists to see if I'm progressing with my life objectives

My experiment - time boxed, for the next 14 days will be to provide written answers to these questions each day on this blog. The thought process for these questions is below 

Twenty questions to ask each day: 

1. what did I do to improve my trading?
2. what did I do to advance my understanding and connection to life extension?
3. what did I do to enjoy my life?
4. what did I do to get people in the right place to build a great organization?
5. what did I do today to eat MSCI and S&P Global's lunch?
6. what did I do to research best in class 'wealth preservation' tactics in the new world order?
7. Did I move the ball forward with someone economically aligned with improving my results?
8. was my mobile screen time sub 15 mins?
9. did I eat mediterranean food oatmeal w protein powder and a multi vitamin?
10. did I show up to the gym for 60 minutes?
11. did I hit the bed in time yesterday - namely asleep by 8:15 PM?
12. did I do a daily stand up?
13. do I have clear plans for three weekly meetings in person w the ORG (or over zoom etc)
14. is everything in notebook world committed?
15. is the Gitlab planning process being used
16. Did I follow my morning checklist
17. Did I focus hardcore from 7-10:30 with no PNL checks
18. Did I do my meta-tag based PNL review and write a blurb about it in my trading journal?
19. Am I clear about where I am on my trading and R&D program?
20. did I advance my study of George Soros and his trading



## Strategies

### 1. Understand what you're good at and double down on it
* I am able to trade and generate 20%+ CAGRs with a Sharpe ratio north of 4.5 and 0 market exposure. It is, perhaps, my only skill that is better than the vast majority of other people. I am a poor manager (0 tolerance for failure), a sloppy entrepreneur, and a mediocre coder - but I excel at PNL generation
* I am 32 years old and far too old to learn any useful new skill at scale
* Thus, I have to commit to making trading a huge % of my career for the rest of my life no matter how many friends I have making hundreds of millions from tech entrepreneurship

Question each day:
- what did I do to improve my trading?

### 2. Understand what your goal is in life, succinctly
* I want to make vast sums of money to plow into life extending technologies - whether it's for my children, or myself, I believe death is the final frontier and really the only thing worth fighting
* I want to enjoy a hedonic maximum along the way in the likely event I die. Life's too short not to enjoy its pleasures. I think stoics are boring and their wives tell me the same. 

Questions each day:
- what did I do to advance my understanding and connection to life extension?
- what did I do to enjoy my life?

### 3. Figure out how to get massive equity upside in a technology venture.
* Even though I excel at trading it is clear given the trajectory of taxes, and society in general, that the only way to generate enduring wealth is through ownership of a technology company
* This is especially relevant to trading, which is increasingly driven by technology and the vast majority of other market participants trading the most liquid tech companies are troglodytes. There is real sustainable investing edge that comes from being directly proximate to tech.
* But it is impossible to focus on making a really great company while also trading full time, because of the brutal nature of managing a portfolio well 
* This requires annointing my brother & close friends as the owner of the company and giving him clear instructions that he can execute, and layering an excellent team into the organization
* You can only trust family and people who are close to family for such ventures 

questions each day:
- what did I do to get people in the right place to build a great organization?

### 4. Identify a space that you understand and can dominate with better technology and build a company
* In my case, this is index trading 
* I trade indexes very profitably and always have - reaffirming my belief that the vast majority of people who trade indices have no idea what is in them (Tech Sector ETFs, Nasdaq vs S&P vs Dow etc)
* S&P Global, MSCI and Blackrock are not tech companies but have multiples like they are
* I know they can be destroyed with a mentality of technological excellence
* Ship a product rapidly and get traction with an investment bank selling index swaps. Then use the MOU / initial traction to raise venture money and hire an excellent team

questions each day:
- what did I do today to eat MSCI and S&P Global's lunch?

### 5. Watch the exit ramp. The system is breaking down
* Structure your corporation and your business interests in a way that they are resistant to confiscation
* It is likely that global governments will persecute the rich (esp white males) and take their wealth in order to finance the huge deficit spending they've engaged in for the last 30 years
* I believe Arthur Hayes and CZ Binance are excellent case studies for doing this correctly. Seychelles? HK? Singapore? What is the correct mix? The last thing you want to do is spend 10 years building a sand castle that gets destroyed in a wave of populism.
* Don't accept conventional advice / or deals. Conventional  = confiscated. 

question each day: 
- what did I do to research best in class 'wealth preservation' tactics in the new world order?

### 6. Generate massive alignment with key stakeholders
* My stakeholders are 1) investors in my past companies 2) past fund managers who I made money for 3) people I've made $ for 4) investment banks who want my order flow if I start trading institutional $ again 5) past employees who want my references 6) past clients who liked my work 7) past cofounders
* Right now I don't do a good job mapping out how these people should participate in what I'm doing next, and what will drive the largest $ outcome for them 

question each day:
- Did I move the ball forward with someone economically aligned with improving my results?


## Tactical Lifestyle Improvements

It is important to cut the fat. Right now I don't really have the energy levels to work 12 hours a day trading and an extra 4 hours on a technology venture, and to get there will require some discipline and lifestyle edits. 

### 1. Cut mobile phone usage to 0

* Mobile phones are dopamine machines designed to waste your attention
* I experimented not controlling my screen time and controlling my screen time
* Overall, the benefits of mobile phones (podcasts and more reading) is horrendous relative to the downsides - namely worse sleep

question:
- was my mobile screen time sub 15 mins?

### 2. Simplify diet to be "quasi optimal"
* There's a temptation to be "fully optimal" - in the sense that it's pretty clear that eating a varied diet of fruit vegetables, brown rice, lean chicken etc produces better results. But being fully optimal requires cooking and quite a bit of discipline. It's better to allocate that discipline elsewhere and simply be "good enough" in this category until free cash flow personally is above $50k /month 
* Cooking is too time consuming when incorporating clean up and shopping
* There is a mediterranean place close by with relatively good chicken, rice and salad. The beef makes me feel bad so I'll avoid that (I can't have too much iron)
* I will just change my diet to be oatmeal, protein powder, a multi vitamin and this for the forseeable future with minimal thought outside that 
* Certainly I could make the diet cheaper, better, or tastier, but that would require too much time and I don't really give a fuck about food 

question:
- did I eat mediterranean food oatmeal w protein powder and a multi vitamin?

### 3. Implmenet "Showing up" gym regimen
* Think I need to acknowledge esp w Covid craziness that it's somewhat unlikely for me to have an excellent gym routine
* Instead, near term I'd rather have a "standard" - i.e. a bare minimum, versus an objective
* 1 hour a day, just go to the gym - no guarantee what youre doing there. If you want, you can just stand there. Just show up in gym shorts
* on balance, don't bring your phone - even though you could 'read the economist' it probably lowers the likely intensity. It's good to get some animal aggression going in the gym and that's not compatible with headphones or listening to the 20 minute VC while idly peddling 

question:
- did I show up to the gym for 60 minutes?

### 3. hardcore bed time via "hit the book" hard stop

* Because I wake up at 4:15 AM each day, if I am sleep deprived my performance degrades which affects trading PNL. This isn't acceptable
* I cannot sleep if I'm doing due dilligence on companies or watching TV directly before bed
* I can only sleep in a guaranteed fashion if I read a paperback book before bed - doesn't matter the topic. Kindles are a non starter. There could be something about the electric charge
* I need to go to a bookstore and purchase books for this / get rid of the obsession with "minimal possessions". I can always donate them after I'm done 

question:
- did I hit the bed in time yesterday - namely asleep by 8:15 PM?

## Organizational improvements

Right now - my organization is loose and undisciplined. There are sometimes scope documents, sometimes milestones, sometimes agreements on what is going to get shipped and by when. Fundamentally it's two brothers hacking together, and doesn't feel like a real business. This is a problem and needs to change. This is difficult as I'm not naturally an organized person. 

### 1. Implement daily stand up

The bare minimum is a daily stand up. This at least gives us "state" and removes the option to deprioritize the project

Question:
- did I do a daily stand up?

### 2. Implement tri weekly in person meetings

This can be initiated by me. In practice this means making the apartment a nice place to work in. 
Likely meeting are going to be Tuesday, Friday and Sunday

Question:
- do I have clear plans for three weekly meetings in person w the ORG (or over zoom etc)

### 3. Minimum notebook policy

Goal is that there aren't tons of random cells running in ipyhton notebook. By end of the day any "state" you have should either be committed or discarded. This minimizes personal ram expenditures 

Question:
- is everything in notebook world committed 

### 4. Gitlab planning process

the goal should be to have milestones with goals underneath them that you're working towards and that other members of the org are setting their own goals and managing their processes in a way that's communicable (complete w time estimates )

Question:
- is the Gitlab planning process being used


## Trading improvements

Right now, I'd say my process is working but it's too poorly put together.

### 1. Morning "statistical opportunities"

Each morning you should be reviewing incremental statistical opportunities generated by the previous evening's price action. The morning checklist needs to be ammended to be more focused on incremental opps vs current which is heaivly focused on portfolio construction and too hectic
Question:
- Did I follow my morning checklist

### 2. "Dead Zone".
From the hours of 7 AM - 10:30 AM it is functionally not very useful for me to be actively trading. I would get more out of shipping code or reading transcripts during this time period without the distraction of PNL, then re-engage around 10:30 - 1 for my evening trades

Question:
- Did I focus hardcore from 7-10:30 with no PNL checks


### 2. Daily review of both evening and day session profits

Grouped by meta tag, make sure you write in your trading journal why you lost money on things and if it feasibly could have been avoided, how would you have gone about it

Question:
- Did I do my meta-tag based PNL review and write a blurb about it in my trading journal?

### 3. Clearer R&D development pipeline

Similar to org process need to be developing trading in the same way -- esp going into earnings season when all R&D has to be halted want to get this in order. 

Question:
- Am I clear about where I am on my trading and R&D program?

### 4. Study of Soros

Historically when I read and listen to Soros extensively, I channel better macro-economic and qualitative trading. Little things like reading Popper, watching Druckenmiller videos, absorbing his mindset and process improve PNL generation for me historically. I think this is worth more formal exploration - so I think - to execute a more structured process, I'd like to write a book on Soros trading methodlogy complete with an exhaustive reading of his inspirations 

- did I advance my study of George Soros and his trading?
