## Mental / Wellness

* 15 mins mindfulness a day (5 mins at end of 25 min pomodoros, 3 times) - logged on apple watch 
* Daily phone screen time sub 2 hours
* Should be practicing Spanish daily to integrate into local community. Best time for this is 1 hour before bed via physical book 

### Stress Zero: Adjusted CBT Protocol

Once a day, I run a process called Stress Zero in order to directly bump my HRV and try and get my stress to zero. The best times to do this are on morning walks or on the way back from work 

1. I record these exercises in the OtterAI app so that I have logs of stressors and intentions over time for analysis
2. Every exercise starts out with an Intention - i.e. a spiritual goal, that flows from my perception of a higher power. I try and keep the Intention something profound and meaningful to me and link it to the tactical space
3. Next there is gratitude - I explicitly talk about something I'm grateful for and why
4. Next are stressors. I identify a stressor, and then I "debunk" the stressor. The way I do this is typically A] Acknowledging the positive underlying intent of the Stressor B] Identifying irrational threads in the stressor so that the stressor falls in on itself C] Identify the self defeating nature of the stressor - i.e. typically if you're super stressed about something you're not taking action towards the positive intention
5. When possible, try and link defeating the stressors to the Gratitude, or Intention functions to maximize repetition 

## AI Decisionmaking

I've made the decision to let AI systems augmented with context and KPIs fully supplant most of my personal and professional choices. I wrote about this in my last post ["Firing Myself"](https://goodalexander.com/2023/07/02/firing-myself/) but here I want to delve into the minimum viable execution for this system. 

### Autonomous Self / Corporation Agreements
1. Continually upload as much context as possible to internal tracking software
2. Always update KPIs so that this context is framed in terms of objective performance
3. Constantly use the best AI models to parse this context and help me apply it to moving towards KPIs
4. Whenever possible automated collection of context, and KPIs to minimize mental overhead
5. Clearly define and be bought into my Objective Function (what I'm working towards), my Constraints (what I'm willing to give up) and my Values (the things underpinning my objective function/ constraints). I call the Objective Function, Constraints and Values my 'Default Setting'
6. Reference the Default Setting when definining personal and corporate milestones or making large strategic decisions
7. Periodically improve and refine systems to make 1-6 better 

### Daily Professional Processes:
* ~6 AM - 9:40 AM - pomodoros 
* 9:40 AM - review morning trading execution, ensure risk systems have worked 
* 9:45-10 AM: Prepare for stand up via taking yesterday’s tasks/ pomodoros/ etc as well as Milestone document and running through GPT4  
* 10 AM: morning stand up notes uploaded to Database. Morning stand up should always state what milestones are being worked
* 11 AM is the workout / target finish eating by 1 PM 
* 8 PM: notes uploaded to database summarizing days work. KPI sheets updated (qualitative assessment script is run - which is a GPT4 powered questionnaire). 
* 8-8:30 PM Actively do leisure activities (could be calling friends randomly, reading online garbage, watching funny videos, watching TV, playing video games) 
* All work done via Pomodoros (25 min blocks w 5 min breaks) where content of Pomodoros is logged to the database 

### Weekly Processes (Sunday)
* 1-2 hours spent writing weekly reviewing past week and
* Updating Sprint Plan / Milestone Document
* Grocery shopping / meal prep (lentil dish is bulk preparation) 
* 2-3 hours of feature implementation of software features to improve overall systems architecture
* Maid every other week 

### Flexibility and Acknowledging Limitations

Though the system above is challening to implement, my goal is 100% compliance.

I want to outline actively what happens if 
1. KPIs don’t get updated 
2. stand ups are missed 
3. workouts / diet adherence drops 
4. Pomodoros don’t get updated / done 
5. Other MVEs not reached

If the system drops below qualitative compliance threshhold I hire a personal coach to make me execute it
