      <description>Why am I doing what I am doing? A direct summary of all the esoteric garbage I&amp;rsquo;ve produced.
Dumbing it all down I’ve written a lot on this blog. I want to dumb it down. Speak in 10th grade English. Below I’m going to talk about what I think the dominant life strategy is, and why. Basically - it’s trying to make as much money as possible, at the intersection of crypto AI and capital markets, while living in Puerto Rico.</description>

      <description>channeling momentum, mojo, reading the universal mosaic
Below I explore the idea of “the Mo” - or being in tune with the universe, in a useful way that allows you to take larger risks and do better work - but only in short bursts.
Famous fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller has stated that the most fundamental job of a trader is knowing whether or not he has a “hot hand”. When you have a hot hand, you size up.</description>

      <description>What the Optimization Bros Have Wrong and How to Fix It
Willpower and Capability Gaps Consider “screen time”. Every Sunday, Apple Users get our screen time report. And every Sunday we say, “You know, next week I’d love for that to be below 1 hour per day.”
And - it’s seldom below 1 hour per day.
This is one, quantified gap. I am bringing it up because many people are familiar to it and can relate to it.</description>

      <description>a philosophy for simple folk pursuing Faustian bargains with future Intelligence
All things are either addictive, or non addictive.
All activities either align with your true calling or they do not.
Thus - any activity can fit into 4 quadrants
Addictive and not aligned with your calling. This is the worst - examples would be injection drugs Addictive and aligned with your calling. An example would be taking uppers to go faster towards your goals.</description>

      <description>One man&amp;rsquo;s screen time is another man&amp;rsquo;s profit. Mental models and tools of a digital samurai.
Screentime Check I’m sure you’ve experienced the same thing I have. Sunday comes around. Apple displays your weekly screen time. And you ask, “Wait, what the f*ck? How did I spend so much time on my iPhone? What was I thinking?”
And, you probably know at some level, you weren’t thinking. And that was the entire point.</description>

      <description>An exploration into accelerationist extremism and its logical conclusions
Below I’m going to get into some very pragmatic behavior modifications that could follow logically from accelerationist beliefs.
Advances in AI, and biotechnology make it seem likely there will be substantial medical breakthroughs in our lifetime. However - I do not think these breakthroughs - which will include genetic modification of children, and live therapies - will be distributed to society. Even more - I think developments will be kept secret.</description>

      <description>naming negative nostalgia. exploring clarity in a world with infinite RAM
Naming the Culprit A single concept applies to bad investing, bad decision making, and bad feelings. The idea is living in the past.
I began exploring this concept by speaking to my friend Kyla about nostalgia, and its role in Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, guys who only eat meat, luddite behavior, and economic desperation. She recorded a video about it here</description>

      <description>the subject synthesizes various life experiences, failures and ideas into a singular life philosophy revolving around consciousness
Consciousness forms a universal building block of existence.
In moments of profound exertion, when I am at my best - I experience this vividly. A “flow state” - a peak experience, is defined by a feeling of ‘the universe flowing through me’. Many people experience this when using psychedelics. When the ego dissolves, you can interact with the base layer of reality.</description>

      <description>minimum viable execution marching towards the singularity
Minimum Viable Execution Below I want to outline the list of Diet, Exercise, Mental Health and Personal Automation tactics I&amp;rsquo;m implementing until at least January 5 2024.
This post is meant to be an addendum to my previous post &amp;ldquo;Firing Myself&amp;rdquo; where I zone in specifically on Personal Automation tactics. That post, in a nutshell, talked about how to use AI tools like GPT4 to make better regular decisions with less energy.</description>

      <description>deprecating Alex 1.0, applied accelerationism, ego death with a postgres backend
Encountering the Power of AI in Financial Decisions Algorithms from social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, along with the whole digital marketing industry, work non-stop to hook us on products and services that aren&amp;rsquo;t good for us.
AI differentiates itself from Tech 1.0 by giving users the power of algorithms to improve their lives, rather than be victimized by them.</description>

      <description>a reflection on Nietzsche, Artificial Intelligence, goldfish, and new Gods
“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?</description>

      <description>one last musing before the descent into the digital colosseum
Digital assets and the political media have wrapped around each other, a double helix of increasingly epic proportions. It has not always been like this, but a glimpse of where we are today, before discussing the portal that’s opened behind my casomputer chair that I am about to step through -
Central bankers posting their thoughts on the daily to the derision of random armchair Austrian economists on the internet.</description>
