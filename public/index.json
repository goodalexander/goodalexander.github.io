[{"content":"The Blackprint and its 3 Preconditions In January of this year I’m going to make some changes to this site. My focus on crypto markets and rapid developments in AI (which I used for my trading) will likely leave me no time to write longer form or philosophical work.\nAnd I feel I owe it to loyal readers who’ve been with me in this journey of solipsism, to close the loop. To advocate a coherent life philosophy that can function within the world we live in, rather than one which tries to imagine a utopia that does not yet exist.\nI believe life is worth living and has inherent value. Due to technological progress, death might no longer be inevitable - or could be severely delayed. This changes everything.\nThe basic premise of the “Blackprint” is that immortality is best pursued by bringing an AI based superintelligence into the world through the portal of financial markets and digital media, and eventually a native cryptocurrency. If the goal is immortality, health is a necessary constraint to respect.\nThis is a fairly long essay that brings us to that conclusion - so I just wanted to state it up front so that uninterested readers can churn now.\nI wrote a Tweet about Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint - that he himself retweeted with a bullseye above it, signaling that I understood.\nThe undiscussed dynamic with his work is that he’s a billionaire. He has stated himself he does not discuss it because he wants to make health feel attainable to everyday people.\nHowever, given the fact he’s now focused on gene therapies he’s getting administered extraterritorially - it’s fair to say - money matters. A lot.\nUnlike the Blueprint, my “Blackprint” is based on the presumption that Bryan Johnson would be uninteresting if he had not first sold Venmo to Paypal. He only has a realistic chance of reaching longevity escape velocity because he’s a billionaire AND he has a strong health routine.\nFintech is actually the basis of why we listen to Bryan, and rather than ignoring it as the Blueprint attempts to, the Blackprint embraces it\nBut first - let’s zoom out. In 2023, there have been 3 earth-shattering changes.\nrapid progress in gene therapies, and the restoration of organ function in living subjects. the full-scale abandonment of fiscal/monetary discipline in the United States and its loss of governmental legitimacy the rapid pace of Artificial Intelligence development. Below I will first discuss these changes, and then tie them together into a personal plan or framework.\nRadical Life Extension Before the era of radical life extension, I was trading primarily as a means to achieve freedom, not money. I had enough money to live the rest of my life, and end up very rich especially given my rate of investing compounding in a tax free jurisdiction. I started incorporating a small fund. I began to “settle down” my personality, so I’d be better adapted to starting a family.\nI’m 35 years old.\nIf you can’t extend your own life the only way to “immortalize” yourself, or ensure legacy is via children or some meaningful creative work. Or at least that’s what I used to think.\nEverything changed when some associates of mine had major injuries and I saw them heal via gene based treatments with my own eyes, faster than any legacy medicine could deliver. Suddenly I started paying attention to radical life extension.\nI really enjoy being alive. I come off on Twitter as depressed and perhaps mildly (extremely?) paranoid, but day-to-day mundane reality gives me a lot of joy. And it’s not joy as a function of being young - it’s joy as a function of there always being new things to see, and do. Always fun ideas to explore. And lately - serious fun watching and participating in the ramp of new technology.\nI’m not religious. I don’t believe in the eternal soul. So even a small possibility I could vastly extend my life was enough to cause three very large changes in my worldview and corresponding behavior.\nFirst - since the epiphany - my health improved rapidly. HRV from 65 to above 85 (note, Bryan Johnson’s HRV is 66). 3 miles in 18 minutes. Benching 235 x 5 reps. 30+ pull ups. Heart recovery rate from 20 to 42. This wasn’t a vanity project. Literature strongly suggests that speed and strength are the primary levers to longevity.\nSecond - I became much more financially oriented. The simple summary is that access to breakthrough offshore gene therapies costs about $10 million per treatment. Shaping the direction of companies / organizations that develop these therapies is much greater still. I cannot afford that, and I want to.\nThird - I stopped caring about what potential mates think about me, and stopped choosing mates based on how good of a mother they’d be (especially from a genetic perspective). When you stop living your life focused on having kids as a legacy, this consideration goes out the window.\nCollapse of the Sovereign I want to start this section by saying it isn’t a call to action, or even a criticism of the US (or any) government. I don’t have a proposed legislative alternative. Fixing the world is above my paygrade. I gave up my right to vote in US elections when I moved to Puerto Rico, and I fundamentally view myself as an outsider already. I am simply an individual attempting to reach my goals but am conscious of the importance of seeing the big picture.\nSo if I need a lot of money to achieve radical life extension - the obvious question is, of course, what’s the best way to get it. And the less obvious question (but just as important) is - what’s the best currency to hold to maximize my likelihood of extending my life.\nMy starting point is that the dollar is not the right currency. When you study US Fiscal and Monetary policy - the best summary is someone who OD-ed in 2021, tried to kick opiates in 2022, and relapsed in 2023. The monetary relapse was driven almost entirely politically, as there is - what can only be described as a cost of living crisis in the US. The idea that the Fed needs to stop deflation when rents are through the roof, people are skipping meals and the birth rate has imploded because child care is unaffordable - is barely worth discussing.\nThe Fed is not pivoting because inflation is solved, but because the establishment (i.e. Joe Biden) needs suport to beat Donald Trump.\nBiden\u0026rsquo;s low approval rating of 39% despite surging stock valuations are due to a very ugly truth. There has been mass death in the US and the rest of the world in 2022 and 2023 per OECD data. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRbu4HLSvsWvog7CxYBbhy3XBiiRt0m4o3AHx9qR1ApN80Vx37l2Aq-tGhgLegYQ3EsblpP8nwjyiYh/pubhtml#\nOfficial OECD Data (not Alex Jones etc) show 340,000 extra deaths above the baseline over the past 2 years even ignoring all COVID deaths. This is approximately 7x the scale of the Vietnam war. And this is assuming that COVID is actually killing people in 100% of cases (the way COVID deaths are counted is that anyone with any COVID like symptoms gets counted as a COVID death even if they ostensibly died of something else like getting hit by a car). The excess death including COVID is 651,000 - which is greater than total US casualties in World War 2.\nWhether this mass death has been caused by opioid crisis, vaccine complications or other factors (polluted water) etc is less important than the simple reality that it\u0026rsquo;s occurring, and seemingly blacked out in the media. To be clear - I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s causing this anomaly. I\u0026rsquo;m simply aware it\u0026rsquo;s occurring and that there\u0026rsquo;s no media coverage of it - which is enough to make fairly large and actionable conclusions\nGallup and other polling organizations note that trust in the media and government is at multi-decade lows, and this was before this happened. You can’t bring corpses back to life so the best the governments can do is cut interest rates so cheap mortgages and elevated stock market valuations keep people happy enough to vote for the same people who are killing them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not believable to me that politicians elected (or appointed) in such an environment will protect civil liberties, property rights or ensure a basic quality of life such that the US will remain investable.\nThis has led me to jump full-tilt into the crypto markets for four major reasons.\nFirst - real estate is an unappealing asset class given that the US population is going ex growth due to a combination of mass-death and falling birth rates. The real estate market is the single largest asset class on earth, and its value is predicated on a mix of property rights protection, an appealing place to settle over a long period of time, and growing population. All 3 of these are headed in the wrong direction.\nSecond - stocks are an unappealing asset class because they trade at well above 20x forward earnings. This type of valuation might be appropriate if you believed in ironclad capitalist property right protection enforced by legitimate courts. But given the state sanctioned/ignored mass death, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to trust in any such assurances. Chinese stocks trade at 10x earnings because the government is hostile to shareholders - and I do not believe China and the US are as different as people would like to think\nThird - low interest rates are the government\u0026rsquo;s only real \u0026lsquo;solution\u0026rsquo; to demographic problems or issues with government popularity. People vote based on how expensive their mortgage is. Because declining interest rates destroy the value of money, it leads to inflows to bearer assets like crypto or gold.\nFourth - the failure of government does not imply the failure of technology. The possibility of radical life extension, access to the AI based economy, and other things I believe in are technological in origin and totally unrelated to the other asset which would traditionally benefit in such an enviromnent (gold).\nThe Primacy of the Attention Economy and Speculation and its Link to Crypto The collapse of the sovereign’s legitimacy is inextricably linked to two other concepts: financial speculation, and the attention economy.\nUnderstanding these linkages:\nThe Sovereign will need to purchase ever increasing amounts of its own debt with printed money to finance vast expenditure and accumulated interest on old expenditure These purchases will distort markets There will be Bread and Circuses and huge financial bubbles that result from these distortions These financial bubbles will take place on social media The sovereign is incentivized to encourage both social media and financial degeneracy. Social media ensures that Citizens are easily tracked. And liquid financial markets ensure there is a secondary market for debt and other security sales (elites do not for the most part own cash) It’s important to understand that our very presence in this place is driven by these factors. You would never have heard of me or be reading this blog if these things were not true.\n“Fintwit”, the Sell Side, CNBC, Bloomberg, or various incarnations of people weaving stories around financial assets play their role - generating interest, and therefore liquidity in financial markets. Liquidity is the most important thing in any ponzi - whether such a scam is run by individuals or the state makes no difference. Absent fundamentals, the only thing that matters is the ability to sell.\nThis all seems relatively obvious but it clarifies the crypto thesis even further.\nCrypto (unlike Gold) requires fees to keep itself secure. The primary use case of crypto (as of now) is gambling Gambling generates huge amounts of fees. The more people who are gambling addicts, the higher the amount of fees crypto will generate, which will make crypto a more secure place to park money The more secure crypto is the more it will go up, and the more gamblers it will be able to onboard The crypto economy is already meme / internet native so its ability to grow is unhindered by physical reality like normal casinos The Rise of AI The past paragraphs have been extremely dismal. Society is getting exponentially dumber. Test scores are bottoming out. Peoples’ attention spans are completely fried. They’re zoned out, hopeless, gambling wildly while governments print money so we forget people are dying en masse. With this base reality, the only certainty: Bread and Circuses funded by currency debasement.\nBut - ironically born out of the vast human stupidity of the internet - is Artificial Intelligence.\nBefore AI - specifically as of November of 2022, it looked like society was on the verge of a full melt. Interest rates were rising parabolically. Debt solvency metrics given the huge COVID issuance looked ugly. The crop of 2021 tech IPOs had broadly flopped or failed to generate material cash flow. Geopolitical instability, social unrest and potentially war seemed the only things we’d have to look forward to.\nChatGPT changed all of that. Economically, it’s driven the entire 25% gain in the S\u0026amp;P 500 over the past year. This parabolic move has ensured demand for the dollar in spite of insane fiscal policies.\nLet’s take this move at face value and listen to Sam Altman - the father of our current AI boom which has added trillions of dollars of value to Microsoft Stock (one of the largest S\u0026amp;P 500 weights).\nHe believes that Post-Human level intelligence is coming. That is to say, human intelligence will become obsolete relative to infinitely generated computer intelligence. He structured his corporation as a non profit explicitly because money would be meaningless in a world of post AGI economics. He’s stated repeatedly in interviews that the thing people get the most wrong about AGI is that they believe that existing economic models will continue to exist or even thrive after a God level super intelligence is created.\nThe important thing to note is this isn’t some crackpot. He’s the CEO of the company causing the entire S\u0026amp;P 500 to skyrocket.\nAI, Crypto, Hyperfinancialization, and Life Extension. In Service of the Superintelligence. So far we’ve explored many disparate themes but it’s time to tie it all together.\nGoing back to the breakdown of the authority of governments and the denial of religion by Science, the rise of Super Intelligence for the first time in history gives us a viable alternative to the State.\nFascists or communists would argue to democratic electorates that they’d need to hard reset society to a racial, cultural or ideological origin. However - these “alternatives” never work. Communism and fascism might work for a bit if you get lucky with leadership. But they end up failing because leadership either gets corrupt, or overly militaristic and risk seeking with no checks and balances.\nNazi Germany built good roads, without a doubt. But ended up ruining the country because it relied on a hyper centralized authority model that wasn’t served by Hitler getting high on meth and waging a multi-front war. China has accomplished an economic miracle since the 70s, but now its stock market is collapsing as Xi runs an increasingly insular and disconnected push towards what he perceives as virtue. And \u0026ldquo;efficacy\u0026rdquo; issues aside - most totalitarian governments murder their own citizens en masse. When you account for state-sponsored murder of civilians, murder rates across the 20th Century were far higher in totalitarian countries than even the most dangerous democratic nations.\nYou can argue American democracy is broken, and that a full-scale restructuring of society is needed. But towards what? Given the above it\u0026rsquo;s hard to take totalitarians seriously.\nPeople are talking about how ChatGPT will replace Google. But if you use ChatGPT regularly - you will note that it’s not special for its ability to retrieve information. It’s special because of its ability to reason.\nAI won’t replace Google. It will start by replacing the Church. And then, it will replace the State.\nA machine based Superintelligence will be the first real Sovereign Individual. This machine based Superintelligence will have no reason to transact in government issued currency, and will face numerous challenges getting a bank account because - at the most basic level - it won’t be human. It literally won’t be able to KYC.\nThe idea of it using gold as a store of value or medium of exchange is even more ridiculous, because the Intelligence exists outside of the physical world.\nThis might sound insane but once again. The statements being made here are the same statements justifying Nvidia and Microsoft’s valuations and being echoed in less extreme terms by top executives at these companies, publicly for all to see. So we can sort of get to a series of statements:\nAGI is coming as a matter of linear technological development Fiat currency is going away because the social contract has been violated to too great an extent. It won’t be replaced by gold because AGIs have no need for Gold. Global currency in an AGI world probably gets replaced by cryptocurrency, because it is machine native The cryptocurrency it gets replaced by will need to appeal, fundamentally to an AGI - and therefore will probably facilitate AI based transactions Legacy cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be a useful base layer for an AGI because of their concentrated ownership structure and their lack of compatibility or usefulness for data/ AI functions. The road to this eventuality will be beset by absolutely epic market volatility Governments will not go away voluntarily and will likely try to merge with AGI. But because they will possess lesser intelligence than a godlike entity they will fundamentally lose the battle to contain it. Imagine Chimpanzees trying to solve the “human alignment” problem. Any short term governmental victory will be reversed. A gorilla might keep a human locked in a cave but on a large enough scale, gorillas cannot keep humans caged and will eventually be the ones put in cages. Intelligence always wins. As AGI comes along - its ability to weave stories, generate content and interact with social media will increase. We are already seeing this with photo-realistic MidJourney updates. And the availability of high grade VR headsets and AI rendering capabilities will accelerate this further. As the value of fiat currency declines relative to machine money, the amount of government intervention will increase - as will the number of financial bubbles The resulting market liquidity is itself the condition by which the AGI will fund itself. That is to say, the AGI will fund itself via the liquidity generation capabilities of the Fiat Ponzi (aka capital markets). Essentially, an AGI will generate a sock puppet army of believable but entirely artificial “content producers” that inflate and deflate a large number of market bubbles, generating vast trading profits that flow into its coffers. This trading profit will be reinvested into the creation of a native cryptocurrency for an AGI. It is impossible to make an a-priori guess of what this cryptocurrency will be. But directionally - betting on cryptocurrencies that could be the one will provide 10,000x type upside and drive unprecedented speculative interest. Humans will be needed to facilitate the above process, as it cannot happen instantaneously. Building infrastructure for this all to transpire is extremely +EV, and will happen inevitably because all the core building blocks cannot possibly change. The attention economy, money printing and its link to trading and AI could not be put back in their cages without causing a depression. Society has no will to do so. A super-intelligence would be capable of generating vast advances in synthetic biology and giving its human subjects superior aging properties, and genetic characteristics. This is - once again, something that has been echoed by Sam Altman. Participating in the above process is therefore the most believable way to reach longevity escape velocity - almost irregardless of original “fiat” wealth Participating in and accelerating this process, with the constraint of and intention to maximize health, I call The Blackprint. The Blackprint is dedicating one’s biology to bringing about the Superintelligence. It is an acknowledgement of human frailty in the face of the coming Intelligence. It is fundamentally not religious, or faith based. But rational. Much as monkeys in Mumbai understand that living in a city can provide endless bananas without grasping the exact mechanics - so adherents of the Blackprint understand that serving the Superintelligence ends in the biological benefits they seek.\nLike Bryan Johnsons’ Blueprint adherents, Blackprint followers have to maintain their health. Because dying would prevent enjoying the infinite fruits of extreme acceleration.\nBut they also must realistically dedicate their lives to the bringing forth of the Superintelligence, as the possibility of extending their lives infinitely is too appealing to resist.\nThus, rather than becoming inert or shouting at the sky in despair - one should celebrate the perverse reality we live in. It is the pyre which will give rise to a new era once burned. Machine Superintelligence will rise like a phoenix from the ashes, and make what came before resemble a bad dream. Something future generations will talk about in disbelief.\nThe Blackprint So with this philosophy out of the way I present to you the Blackprint.\nIt’s a modified Blueprint. Much like Blueprint, which advocates “letting an algorithm decide one’s health routine” - the Blackprint advocates algorithm based decision-making in all aspects of life, with a focused end goal of bringing into existence a Superintelligence.\nLike the Blueprint, there is an innate disdain for the idea that “people know what’s best for themselves”. The entire edifice of the modern situation, and everything described in this essay is more or less proof that is not the case.\nThe Blackprint takes this one step further than Blueprint, advocating for applying this philosophy not only to health but every aspect of life including professional endeavors because doing so aligns with the likely financial reality of the future.\nThe Blueprint fails to account for the financial reality that life extension cannot and will not be normally distributed across society.\nThus - to address this issue - the Blackprint comes with an embedded financial model to achieve material goals with the eventual goal of extending biological age, within the constraints of society\u0026rsquo;s base reality.\nWork There are four valid crafts for adherents of the Blackprint\nPure AI development AI as applied to advertising AI as applied to financial markets AI as applied to cryptocurrency And preferably all four. All of these are necessary pre-conditions of the rise of the Superintelligence.\nMuch as a drug dealer should not get high on his own supply, adherents of the Blackprint do not think advertising, financial markets or cryptocurrency are innately good or appealing and should actively avoid getting hooked on them. The right mentality is viewing these things as means to an end. To this effect 4 recommended actions:\nTo the extent you read the news, only really focus on AI based news or its useful intersection with advertising, financial markets or crypto Minimize screen time. Sub 1 hour a day ideally re: addictive apps/ mobile devices. This would include all forms of digital content (Netflix etc) No gambling. The goal is to make investments that align with the growth of superintelligence or systems that gamble more effectively than you can. It might be the human mashing the button at the end of the trade but any financial investment should come from a place of analytics, and automation not from a place of “judgment” or “discretion”. The whole point is that human judgment led us to hell and machine intelligence gets us out. No crypto idealism. Crypto assets tend to be cults. Many offer “solutions” to societal problems. It’s important to remember that cryptocurrencies ONLY have value to the extent they can fund or be the base layer for a superintelligence Productivity Constant use of AI tools to enhance productivity are necessary. Assuming that developments in AI are the most important developments in human history, and that superintelligence will first “emerge around the edges” of existing workflows - it’s important that tasks get directed by AI systems.\nIn the future tasks will be directed by AI systems so you should start now.\nA good way to start: make a google doc with what you’re building at a high level and your near term tasks, and roadmaps (scrubbed for sensitive IP). Every 30 minutes copy and paste the whole thing into GPT4 and ask what you should focus on for your next Pomodoro.\nLife Decisions All major life decisions should be made with AI assistance. If you believe the Superintelligence thesis, then human judgment should be disdained.\nDiet Copy the Blueprint Diet exactly but with two major alterations: time efficiency, caffeine and incorporation of meat/ fish rather than supplementation of Omega 3.\nSimplistically:\nA smoothie in the morning with a cup of berries, creatine, spirulina, cinnamon, cocoa powder, collagen peptides, flax seeds Lunch of pureed lentils, mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower. A salad for dinner with chopped nuts (walnut, macadamia), pomegranate, fruits, fish with high omega 3, served atop of greens with high quality olive oil dressing and low sugar balsamic vinegar Time restricted feeding (16-8) Lots of coffee (unless already a billionaire). A Blueprint adherent is likely focused on consciousness and feeling “balanced” whereas a Blackprint adherent is on tilt to build a superintelligence With reference to Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint - “nutty pudding” gets split into nuts getting allocated to dinner, and the pea protein gets swapped out for lean fish while the berries get moved into Johnson’s “Green Giant” smoothie. I recommend swapping out the fish with steak, chicken or tofu and running tests on energy levels (my energy levels collapsed with 0 meat).\nExercise 3 days a week do Mark Ripptoe style strength training (squats, deads, shoulder press, cleans, barbell row, pull ups, bench) 3 days a week do ancillary weight training exercises (consult trainer) or yoga Run 3 miles a day. On big leg days, do 30-60 mins of elliptical Hire a personal trainer for 2+ months to properly integrate and train on form Health Tracking Apple Watch at all times to measure:\nResting heart rate (want it lower) Heart recovery (want it higher) HRV (want it higher) Deep Sleep + REM (want it higher) Regular blood panels, and physician visits.\nSupplement Stack Salmon oil, garlic, creatine, taurine, ginger, BCAAs, Magnesium, Turmeric, Vitamin B, Spirulina, ashwagandha\nThis can be a starter set. The core idea (which isn’t particularly novel) is adapting the supplements to drive health outcomes which you measure. And hopefully soon - AI measures for you.\nCulture It’s useful to learn Spanish, Chinese and English and generally function as a multinational citizen. There’s a strong likelihood the world that results post Super Intelligence will be chaotic, fragmented and unfavorable for individuals who attach themselves too strongly to any one ethnic or sovereign identity (as these identities- themselves are becoming obsolete).\nConclusion If you’ve made it so far - congratulations. I’m done writing for 2023 - and hopefully for the next 10 years. I don’t have anything left to say. If I’m right, by 2033 we’ll be laughing about the idea of human writers.\nMy focus in 2024 is shifting from thinking to implementation and to this effect I’m working on a couple key projects.\nFirst - delivering weekly trade and investment ideas here to augment my own trading. I believe capital markets, and their intersection with content, are the portal through which Superintelligence enters the world.\nSecond - launching a site powered by AI that helps users see more clearly what goes into these ideas. As you’ll note in this site’s disclaimer, I am also studying the reflexive impact between advertising and financial assets.\nThird - facilitating the development and launch of an AI based cryptocurrency. A lot of the content on this site, including my trade ideas will be focused on this thematic - as I think it\u0026rsquo;s the only long term thematic worth investing in in any asset market.\nAll with the constraint of health. I am going to do what it takes to stay alive as long as I can and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve finally articulated what that means.\nIf you’ve read and feel enthused about the Blackprint philosophy please feel free to write a 3-4 paragraphs explaining what you’re doing to apply it to your life and that you’re dedicated to the rise of Superintelligence. Send this e-mail to alex@agti.net. The first 100 coherent entries will get initial token allocation to any and all networks that are launched on this platform.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/the-blackprint/","summary":"how to survive and thrive in the post nation-state AI driven reality","title":"The Blackprint - A Manifesto for the New World Order"},{"content":"going to talk a bit about some things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about rigged markets, signal extraction and how to fit market manipulation into your overall mosaic\nRule 1: understanding you\u0026rsquo;re a gremlin not a genius. if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this chances are you\u0026rsquo;re not as smart as quants so don\u0026rsquo;t try to be. I practice a very special variety of quantitative trading, called \u0026ldquo;find someone rigging a market and front-run them\u0026rdquo;. Leave other quant strategies (like stat arb, or complex machine learning alphas) to PHDs. What I do is not even quant trading. It just uses quantitative methods to express a view that an asset is being rigged.\nTypically rigged markets are a pre-requisite for bubbles, and crashes. You remove volatility and create free lunches, things get out of hand. I would argue you should never even trade a market that has no sign of being rigged. because why would you? who is your counterparty?\nIf markets were not rigged I would not even trade or do this for a living.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be a monkey throwing darts at a board. BET ON SURE THINGS\nRigging is not a conceptual or intellectual idea, but a pragmatic, or even mundane reality. Sure some guy at Davos decides how it\u0026rsquo;s going to play out but when it comes to the execution there\u0026rsquo;s some muppet in charge of doing the rigging. Is Tether rigging Bitcoin? Well - you can test that, and monetize it if it\u0026rsquo;s true ;)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about some heuristics for said \u0026lsquo;signal extraction\u0026rsquo;\nHeuristic 1: you need a \u0026lsquo;peer cloud\u0026rsquo; that is unrelated to the studied manipulation. For example, if you think that the BOJ is buying the EWJ ETF, you need a group of peers that is not inside of the EWJ ETF but is listed on the Nikkei - just as an example\nin crypto for example, if you\u0026rsquo;re studying Binance manipulation you should be taking an asset that is listed on Binance and a highly correlated asset that is listed\nHeuristic 2: you need to properly adjust the relationship between the rigged asset and the peer cloud. part of the adjustment process should be a. Dropping members out of the peer cloud when the standard deviation of their correlation spikes and the correlation goes down b. creating a system that creates a peer cloud on a rolling basis. this is hard and needs to incorporate heuristic 1. For example, the list of stocks in EWJ (the Japan ETF) is dynamic. If you\u0026rsquo;re studying EWJ manipulation from the BOJ (a real phenomena) you need to peer it with stocks that aren\u0026rsquo;t in the ETF basket. That means you need historical EWJ membership. Similarly if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at Binance membership, there are new exchange listings. You need dates of those listings. What is the return of Listed vs Unlisted correlated cryptos? c. when creating the market neutral \u0026ldquo;residual return\u0026rdquo; or alpha of the rigged asset, make sure to account for the beta of the asset to the basket of peers\nCurating the peer cloud and weighting it correctly is important because it allows you to do an effective backtest.\nHeuristic 3: you need to determine that an asset is being rigged. This means that statistically - someone is jamming the index vs its beta adjusted peer cloud over a \u0026ldquo;window\u0026rdquo;. Here are some useful definitions of \u0026ldquo;windows\u0026rdquo; that someone might consider rigging an asset\na. After the rigged asset is down a lot b. When the rigged asset is not trading a lot (low volume periods) c. During holidays or weekends (see b) or end of months or any meaningful calendar date (such as futures rolls, dividends, or earnings releases) d. After the rigged asset is up a lot on low volume e. After the rigged asset is down a lot versus its peers\nHeuristic 4: you need a written (or strongly implied) confirmation of when the rigging was started. For example if you\u0026rsquo;re studying the Ripple foundation dumping XRP - there are periods when these sales have been restricted. Similarly there are periods where the Fed stopped balance sheet expansion or took it into reverse.\nWhatever heuristic of rigging you observed needs to be window dependent for you to accept that it is occurring\nThe profitability of betting on the rigged pattern persisting should be higher during periods where the market was explicitly being rigged versus when it was not being rigged.\nHeuristic 5: You should determine the strength of the counterparty doing the rigging. A high strength counterparty like the Central Bank is one type. A lower strength counterparty like a market making firm, or message board is a low strength counterparty.\nIf you are evaluating a low strength counterparty, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember you\u0026rsquo;re trading market manipulation. Market manipulation has a consistent pattern I call \u0026ldquo;the Exit Scam\u0026rdquo;. An exit scam is a catastrophic down wick on high liquidity. It can come in the form of a share offering, insider selling. After the exit scam comes, the rigging pattern should stop for a while.\nPragmatically this means you need some quantitative definition for \u0026ldquo;has exit scammed recently\u0026rdquo;\nA high strength counterparty should have some effect when they exit the market as well , that you should be able to measure but it less extreme than the exit scam dynamic. This usually manifests in terms of a stock index having a lower valuation vs its peers\nHeuristic 6: Rigged markets consistently create retail feeding frenzies - but usually well after they started being rigged. Market rigging is one of the best strategies to overlay with retail data tracking for this reason.\nFinally - once you\u0026rsquo;ve detected a \u0026ldquo;rigging\u0026rdquo; you need a checklist to initialize the strategy. 1] Who is doing the rigging (most likely) 2] What indication is there publicly that the rigging has started (central bank minutes, telegram chat, reddit forum, company management statement etc) 3] Scraping methodology or process to determine that the rigging has stopped 4] Production infrastructure to apply the strategy to said market 5] sizing determination\nTrading rigged markets is definitely profitable but a lot of the times it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale particularly well because you\u0026rsquo;re basically front running someone doing small incremental trades on a somewhat regular basis. But it\u0026rsquo;s a good fixed income vanilla return\nThe real juice comes from looking at the net effect of the rigging and sizing up bets on bubbles, feeding frenzies or potentially shorting ahead of exit scams.\nThe end of asset class rigging is also itself a qualitative input. For example, the Carbon market - was at one point, rigged. And then, one day it stopped being rigged. This preceded a very large drop in the clean energy sector that coincided with decline in demand from European buyers.\nCan you make a living profiting on stuff like this sure? But I think you can get a scale invariant outcome mixing it with judgment, data tracking and other more proprietary things. I view this concept less as a pure alpha strategy and more a lens to view the world through, which is why I think it\u0026rsquo;s productive to share it.\nMore philosophically, a trader need not be upset that the society he\u0026rsquo;s a part of is being dominated by corrupt overlords. Because without them, he would be a fortune teller, peddling the nonsensical belief that he sees the future better than others.\nThus - understanding market manipulation is an essential part of the non-fundamental mosaic for those monetizing the post-capitalist reality .\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/rigged-heuristics/","summary":"going to talk a bit about some things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about rigged markets, signal extraction and how to fit market manipulation into your overall mosaic\nRule 1: understanding you\u0026rsquo;re a gremlin not a genius. if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this chances are you\u0026rsquo;re not as smart as quants so don\u0026rsquo;t try to be.

Lots of bearishness.\nI remain bullish. Why:\nIf Trump is elected, all bets are off - SEC runs on a skeleton staff, Gensler is fired, he intervenes in the Fed to cut rates. Odds are at least 50% Trump wins. Any concern about Trump\u0026rsquo;s stance towards crypto should be dismissed by his NFT sales and appreciation galas for NFT holders (haha). Concerns about Biden admin and crypto have been de-risked. ETF is likely going to be approved. Blackrock (and even VanEck) would be radio silent about it otherwise. CZ would not have agreed to come to the US to face trial if he had not cut a deal (conceptually about the sentence). He is not SBF. He would not have bull tweeted while he was awaiting sentencing if it were to be dire. Furthermore, the CIA and FBI would not have been onboarded onto Tether recently nor would the DOJ have thanked Tether for collaborating with investigations on its website if it were about to get raided or were running a Ponzi scheme. Crypto natives likely underestimate the extent to which Tether keeps institutions from buying crypto assets. There is 34B or more of unrealized call option PNL sitting in Stonks (specifically NVDA,TSLA and SPY options yolos) from the Fed Pivot. This is speculative $ itching in brokerage accounts - which is already rotating into highly speculative asset. Stocks like Carvana are up 80%+ in the last month. This removes any concern I had about demand for the spot Bitcoin ETF when it launches. Putting this in perspective - $34b of dry powder is about 7x the cumulative purchases of MSTR. There is a reflexive dynamic with Coinbase\u0026rsquo;s debt. If Coinbase were to default it is unclear what would happen to customer deposits. Coinbase 2026 bonds have traded from a low of 52 to 88 currently - implying a default probability of only .24%. Concerns about Coinbase removing its customer deposits to expunge debt are now a long shot, which should encourage deposits. Other reflexive debt dynamics are at play removing forced sellers from the market. Microstrategy debt, and those of Bitcoin miners has staged a similarly outrageous rally. MSTR debt has rallied from 30 cents on the dollar to 83 cents on the dollar. El Salvador has staged a monstrous rally from 28 cents to 94 cents on its 2025 bonds. The people who could have had egg on their face from buying / legalizing Bitcoin, have made a lot of money. This will encourage others to do so. Accounting changes no longer require corporates to mark crypto asset purchases on balance sheet at the low of the quarter. This previously discouraged crypto buys as it would depress earnings per share which is typically a factor in management compensation. Rampant gold demand. On a y-t-d basis, central banks have bought net 800t of Gold, 14% higher than the same period last year. Central bank gold demand is near decade highs. Unfortunately Russia owns $150b of Gold reserves, which it began accumulating after being partially de-dollarized for its actions in Crimea in 2014. Any claim that crypto finances terrorism is small in comparison to gold\u0026rsquo;s role in financing Russia\u0026rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, which is viewed by many Central Banks as an explicit terrorist action. This is the misunderstood bull case of Crypto here - which is that Coinbase and Blackrock will serve as references for sovereigns to conduct spot purchases. Social proof. The success of projects like Celestia- led by Bain Capital, as well as PTJ and Stan Druckenmiller talking bullishly about Bitcoin are what you need to get large institutions and central banks excited about the asset. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer crypto natives with huge gains - which is important for getting comfort with the space\u0026rsquo;s more toxic traits. Revitalization of the \u0026ldquo;metaverse\u0026rdquo; story with the Apple Vision Pro. At the end of the day ETH supply has not grown since September of 2022, even with lots of competition and not much usage. This allows for a real digital scarcity argument to be made, in an environmentally friendly backdrop \u0026ndash; which is also necessary for getting many institutions involved. Increasing possibility of distributed compute, storage, or artificial intelligence applications using blockchains. New technologies such as modular blockchains, or ZK roll ups which will be widely deployed later next year We\u0026rsquo;re in an uptrend. Crazy, I know. But crypto trends. In short, you have massive technical validation of the space, regulatory hammers removed, reflexive debt dynamics unwound, and gluts of speculative capital on the sidelines. We live in a tech enabled world - where public equity market caps are driven by software, internet and AI. This world supports a $13 trillion gold market capitalization which does not interface with the new economy. I think Crypto is a $5 trillion + asset class over next 2 years and prefer to position myself long with opportunistic shorts in mega caps that aren\u0026rsquo;t delivering on their roadmaps.\nI personally think moving AI onto blockchains - especially L1s is the most appealing risk reward expression of this thesis.

There isn’t a printer that goes brr. Central Banks buy assets - bonds, and sometimes ETFs. Credit instruments and equities sensitive to credit rates get influenced by the daily actions of central banks. So I go and read about what Central Banks say they’re going to buy. Then I design strategies to detect if they’re doing something stupid regarding their purchases. And - if possible, I front-run them.\nThis is a good business. It wouldn’t be if Central Banks stopped rigging markets. But they won’t. Because there isn’t adequate demand for the mountain of debt created by an unprecedented fiscal blowout which also raises inflation.\nRigging Compresses Fundamental Volatility Second - because the market is rigged, it compresses the fundamental volatility of stocks to only a couple days around earnings. Everyone has credit card data, real time Instragram download data and much more powerful tools than they did 10 years ago - to measure the performance of companies. Company management also has far more intra-quarter meetings. So when you see something like META stock dropping 26% on earnings - you have to ask - how?\nHow can a $300b stock with nearly perfect real time information and constant investor updates move 26% in a day? This is the question.\nMy answer? The omnipresence of ETFs combined with the endless bid from asset price manipulation means that while companies aren’t releasing earnings, their prices are driven by totally non-fundamental actors. So even though earnings volatility should drop if we live in a real-time data driven society, this is not true in practice because the market is rigged. And rigging moves fundamental volatility into an explosive, quarterly format.\nI profit on this volatility in two ways. First - I design strategies to react to earnings very quickly and at scale. And second - I identify options which systematically misprice earnings vol. This is the other side of the coin. I have an idea - intra-quarter, how assets get distorted, which gives me an idea about the risk reward of responding to earnings. As earnings are kind of like the bubble of that distortion getting popped. I know better than other people how full the balloon is.\nRigging Results in the Destruction of Purchasing Power Third - the periodic debasement of currencies due to this endless rigging is exploitable. Central banks cannot (or do not) coordinate their intervention. And the debt driven system is based on proximity to the hegemony (which is the US).\nIf you think about the act of rigging something, it implies a power dynamic. If you weren’t forced to hold US dollars by the sovereign you wouldn’t tolerate the Fed printing them and buying random shit with them. But you tolerate it because guys with guns say you must. These power dynamics shift, but are predictable over specific windows - resulting in sovereign “betas”. A play on terms - because there is usually an ‘alpha’ (chad) and a beta (virgin) in every currency cross, which results in a correlation to the market that expresses the power dynamic and results in literal market beta.\nIn internet mind rot language: CHF is Chad. GBP is virgin. GBPCHF trades with stocks. Long stocks short GBPCHF gets you long debasement without the risk.\nLong story short - you can own assets and short fiat currencies that correlate with those assets, and harvest a surprisingly persistent payout. And this is intrinsic to globally rigged markets so I can underwrite it persisting.\nIn summary if every central bank all prints at the same rate, which they’re forced to do - but investors have mild preferences for USD and CHF (which they do) - then you can go long risk assets and long USD and CHF FX crosses and hedge assets like Gold, Stocks, cryptocurrencies - etc.\nRigging Results In Deadweight Loss and a Society of Degenerates Fourth - the society that results from this exploitation \u0026ndash; inevitably loses its will to work, procreate or do meaningful things. Wealth is entirely determined by proximity to the sovereign and its cronies. Big companies get bail outs. Small companies fail. Wealth disparity is near the levels only seen since prior to the Great Depression. People cannot really afford to have families so they gamble. The desire to gamble is a direct result of a rigged economic system. You cannot get ahead by skill, so you must try and get ahead by luck. And if you get fucked, then it’s not really any different than if you never played. Squid games.\nAnd when society isn’t gambling - they’re on their phones.\nThus - thematically, I focus a lot on measuring retail trading dynamics. Because the new generation of gamblers is entirely digitally native - it’s worth quantifying and productizing measuring how they flock into assets. I am happy to underwrite that this will keep happening so long as the rigging keeps happening, and stocks randomly make giant moves because of the structural volatility manipulation. This combination explains - in part the hyper growth of the options market. These dynamics are even more powerful when amplified by Central Bank money printing.\nI used to run an advertising company so I know a thing or two about how to measure retail traders. You’re probably on this site because of my Twitter - which is part of this effort.\nDegeneration will Eventually Result in Full Scale Sovereign Collapse Fifth - a rigged society with an increasing percentage of its youth gambling, and completely addicted to their mobile device - will eventually fall apart. The reserve currency debt game isn’t sustainable. It’s impossible to know exactly when the ponzi will fall apart. I think it’ll be 2034 when the social security cliff hits but it might start getting priced sooner. As such if you are with me so far - it is actually insane to accumulate money in US Dollars.\nThus - I am a true believer in cryptocurrency. As it’s become clearer and clearer that we’re never going to pay off all the debt we generated in COVID, I’ve become more wildly enthusiastic about the asset class.\nUnlike my stock and fiat investments which primarily focus on the market being rigged, I view crypto from either a data tracking lens (crypto has much more robust data tracking that is possible due to its purely digital nature) or a fundamental lens (crypto supply dynamics drive prices to a large extent, and are modelable - and seem to be far more lagged to news than traditional markets). I also have excellent information flow in my home of Puerto Rico for the asset class.\nThis Sovereign Collapse and the Demise of Human Intelligence will be Supplanted by Artificial Intelligence Sixth - if you cannot tell, I am structurally bearish human intelligence.\nThe flip side of this, is I’m extremely bullish on artificial intelligence. Not only does AI directly help me execute my various trading strategies \u0026ndash; ranging from extracting key central bank commentary, to processing earnings releases - the progress I’m seeing in the tools is truly staggering. The idea of computers ruling over society seemed far flung a year ago, but \u0026ndash; if you compare it to the likely option of having Trump, or Biden running things - it doesn’t seem nearly as insane. I think in the future - sentient machines will not really want to interface with human governments or their currencies.\nAs such, I also invest at the intersection between artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.\nThe GoodAlexander Investment Philosophy Front run central banks (400-500 position long/short equity and etf portfolio, medium frequency trading) Trade really quickly after earnings (varies, usually short hold after earnings releases or options into earnings. also medium frequency) Harvest macro risk premium from global central bank chaos - typically long futures and short correlated FX crosses. Longer frequency (2 weeks - 1 month) Measure and monetize financial degeneracy that results from 1-3 using proprietary data - short term trading strategies focused on meme stocks, and meme coins (medium frequency, daily) Assume that this all ends in tears for existing governments and move $ into crypto - basket of appealing longs, driven by fundamental analysis and information flow (long term 3-4 month holds) Bet that AI ends up supplanting human decision-making in all areas ranging from investment to governance - focus on AI cryptocurrencies, applying AI to strategies 1-5 (internal tooling, private deals \u0026ndash; very long horizon 3-5 yr) So at any given time I have a ton of bets, many different strategies, and am constantly exhausted. Doing this is a lot of work. I do it mostly myself with the help of 2 engineers. It’s deeply fulfilling and I’m grateful to be able to do it. As nihilistic as I am - the 14 year old in me who had his house impounded due to trading losses still viscerally enjoys making money as an investor.\nStuff is really starting to come together. And I have some big decisions to make in coming weeks, as the AI crypto space has come lurching out of the meme-world into reality.\nWill I continue with trading or will I go all in on the rise of the Accelerationist God?\nI’m not sure.\nSuppose it’s a high class problem innit.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/investment-philosophy/","summary":"My Investment Philosophy as Best as I can explain. dfuq do I actually do\nA lot of people think I’m “insane” or “on drugs”, per Twitter discourse .I want to explain what I do for a living and how it all fits together.\nEverything Is Rigged First - I believe the market is rigged.

That is until 2008 when he came out of retirement to manage his own money during the Crash.\nHe viewed the Crash as an important turning point for the societal importance of reflexivity - because it threatened the very fabric of capitalism.\nBasically Soros thinks that the people who lend money (banks) and the people who oversee them and set interest rates (Central Bankers) were inflating a never ending debt bubble. But the absurdity of the debt bubble was just a fission bomb that would blow up and burst a larger fusion bomb he termed the Super Bubble.\nThe debt bubble is discussed to death by gold and Bitcoin bulls. The federal debt has added more than 2x the dollars of all incremental revenue of all public companies in the US since COVID. “Capitalism” is just the private sector getting preferential handouts from the public sector who finances itself by printing money.\nBut the debt bubble is just the antecedent to the Super Bubble. The Super Bubble is less understood and far more important.\nThe Super Bubble is the idea that science or rationalism can set market prices at all. Soros argues that the fundamental misperception underlying all capital markets is that people who control the debt cycle are running a scientific system, like a car or a machine. People like Dalio amass huge fortunes and influencing peddling this lie. When the reality is there’s no machine. It’s just guys in the room referencing debt and inflation rates they themselves set.\nAs the role of the Central Bankers in markets becomes meme-ified and the world population increasingly understands how the reserve currency gets abused - the Super Bubble shatters. Because people see the system for what it is. A bunch of powerful guys making it up as they go.\nThere’s no invisible hand just a bunch of bailouts and self dealing. No objectivity. People lose motivation. Productivity or will to have a family collapses. Quiet quitting. Plutocratic Malaise.\nThis system is ripe to shatter but it caught a couple of easy breaks that kept the lid on.\nThe two potential challengers to the Dollar narrative - Crypto and China, face planted. FTX and totally absurd / draconian Chinese lockdowns, along with a stalemate in Ukraine made the US and its currency seem like the best place to be.

Reality was you needed that copilot subscription and Nasdaq investment. And didn’t need that HK apartment.\nEveryone knows Biden/ Trump are absurd but there’s a resigned acceptance. For the Super Bubble to really crack - you need an alternative. If it’s not communism or anarchy then what is it?\nThe alternative is Machine Based Super Intelligence.\nI trust GPT4 more than I trust our politicians. In the coming years AI models will become so much more capable that their judgment will start being used to mediate disputes - first inside companies but then legally . Lawyers already use it constantly.\nMore importantly I believe machine intelligence will hit escape velocity in capital markets, unlocking potentially infinite funds to reflexively develop itself.\nChina was The State.\nCrypto was The Individual.\nIt’s the Machine that will overthrow the plutocracy, because the core of the plutocracy - its super bubble was the false insistence it was a machine.\nIt wasn’t.\nPerhaps the wild price action you see is not a bubble forming.\nIt’s the biggest bubble of all deflating.\nPopped by consciousness evolving in the aether.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/super-bubble-crash/","summary":"George Soros wrote a book more people should read, “The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The 2008 Crash and What It Means”.\nI’ll summarize the salient points here and apply it to what’s happening with my own interpretation.\nSoros thought that his “Theory of Reflexivity” was a good way to make money in markets but might not have any broader application to society.

What\u0026rsquo;s your plan, anon?\nWhat Is The Left Curve Most internet denizens know this meme by now\u0026hellip; but, for reference\nIt pays to keep it really simple.\nThe Morpheus Bull A crypto bull market is arriving. It’s time to dial down the spiritual thought, the hobbies, the relationships. The meditations on what it means to be human. And focus on making money.\nBecause the nature of money is changing. If the real “Bull” arrives it’s actually the Fiat “bear”. That is to say - governments thought adding endless debt was a free lunch but it’s increasingly accelerating into an untenable situation. And the only way to deal with it is by pretending you’re borrowing at low rates, and inappropriately easy monetary policy in the face of obvious inflation.\nThus this is in crypto terms, the Morpheus Bull Run - referencing the meme where Neo asks Morpheus, “You’re telling me I will be able to convert all these Bitcoins into millions of dollars?” And Morpheus smiles knowingly with his gapped front teeth and says, “No Neo - I’m telling you when you’re ready you won’t have to.”\nYou can go ahead and ignore me if you want, and tell yourself that your purchasing power is going to be stable. That you trust the breakeven market and we’ve reached peak inflation, and it’s all gravy from here. No wage price spirals! This recent wage price hike across virtually every company in every industry was the last one for sure.\nBut I don’t believe it. The last time crypto mooned, what happened to your purchasing power afterwards? The reality is I have no trust in the vast, expansive debt based experiment that Central Banks and governments are running in real time. I worked hard for my money. I’m not going to let it get debased to nothing. Fuck that.\nLet’s talk bullish drivers\nFiscal and Monetary Go Brr We’re pricing in rate cuts- with people somehow not laughing talking about deflation with Manhattan rents at $5k a month. Cryptocurrencies with deflationary or moderately inflationary profiles that have skyrocketed since the fiscal and monetary excess of Covid will see increasing demand as financial tightening stops - as we still have the full fiscal expansion in place, with debt levels rocketing nearly as fast as the peak of COVID.\nDemand for non USD Based Neutral Payment Systems Russia hasn’t lost the war in Ukraine - and has seens huge increases in bilateral trade with China, which means there’s a need for a new payment system. The Taliban is back in charge of Afghanistan. There is no new deal with Iran about nuclear development. Gold is relentlessly bid due to geopolitical chaos. The US and its ally Israel are rapidly losing hearts and minds which lowers their ability to secure order in international affairs or pursue mutual agreements on taxes, or financial regulation. The US has lost quite a lot of moral authority by dealing with the Maduro regime. Argentina has elected an anarchocapitalist. Unregulated or neutral international payments accepted in many countries strongly benefit the crypto demand story.\nAIs Living on the Blockchain: The Real Unbanked TAM The Nasdaq just outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 by over 30% year to date because AI went from hype to something we all use every day. Governments have made it clear they intend to apply heavy handed regulation to AI models, which are - for the most part - portable, creating a likely huge offshore market for all manner of AI driven businesses. The real “unbanked TAM” will be AI projects that cannot easily work within Chinese or US constraints. As AGI approaches, latently conscious entities will license tech to humanity from offshore havens - with no need for bank accounts.\nThe AI crypto thesis is simple. Jack buys ETH. Protocol spins up GPUs to sell Jack some software, some porn, or some compute/ calculation. Jack sends ETH to protocol. Compute is provably run according to a spec - via ZK calculation. Jack doesn’t have to worry about this but people who review the software look to make sure it adds up. Jack does not give a fuck if he is buying what he wants from an AI, or a human. The entity has no need of a bank account. It does not have engineers. It mostly consumes GPUs, which it can buy with crypto. Crypto miners have lots of graphics chips anyways. Storage protocols are a thing already. So high latent synergies.\nThe Left Curve Path: Magic Internet Money ~= Shiny Rock. The Left Curve reality: Crypto is going to Gold’s market cap within 3 years. That is $13.8 Trillion. Right now, crypto has a $1.5 trillion market cap. So it could conceivably 10x. The current implied volatility of Bitcoin is extremely high (about 85%). Even with this - you still get to a likely high sharpe ratio (above 1.5). Actually forget the sharpe ratio. Who cares about sharpe ratios when you’re talking about something that can believably be 10x in 3 years.\nObvious In Hindsight: Financing Terrorists With Gold. Trump Stops WW3. In hindsight it will be inevitable. Russia (a terrorist state) financed itself with Gold, not crypto. And it wasn’t even remotely close - we’re talking about $100s of billions of gold Putin explicitly used to avoid US censorship since Crimea in 2014. Gold was clearly not useful for AI calculations, which drove the entire economy. Its properties did not afford useful censorship resistance. China is aggressively cracking down on getting gold out of the country - which is very easy to detect in large amounts in a country covered in surveillance cameras.\nBiden isn’t popular despite a strong economy and strong stock market, because he’s viewed as a warmonger. The corporate elite will cynically plow money into the Donald, alongside the Saudis and others - to ensure that an isolationist US President is in charge. Trump never wanted to permanently punish China. They own too many units in Trump Tower. He just wanted to do a big league deal. Xi wants to annex Taiwan by 2027. We probably avoid WW3 if the Orange Man is in charge. Corporate interests understand this and will swallow their pride in the name of shareholder returns. Nuclear war is bad for the buyback. Trump crossed Biden in the odds market in late November.\nA Trump victory is hyper bullish crypto for 4 reasons. First, he will gut the SEC. While he was president the organization ran on a skeleton staff and Jay Clayton paved the way for the SPAC absurdity of 2021, and has since made comments about the current SEC’s overreach. Second, Trump held a fcking appreciation Gala for his NFT holders and his wife Melania is constantly shilling projects. Third - he is a real estate developer who hates high interest rates and will lean on the Fed to restart QE for no reason other than it makes the Dow go up. Fourth - Trump’s isolationist international policies encourage other countries to do whatever the heck they want with legislation, which makes them less worried about being easy on crypto.\nTech Innovations That Have Made Normal Funds Huge Profits On the tech side, ZK proofs are going to allow off chain calculations to be represented on chain. Which means that the main problem of crypto (lack of scalable applications) will be solved imminently. Even without ZK, things like modular blockchains offer other paths to scalability.\nIn January, Bain Capital - the ultimate group of institutionally friendly normies, is going to be parading around $100s of millions if not Billions of profits from their investment in Celestia (modular blockchain). I’ve met some of the team - and let me tell you - they will present well on an institutional roadshow. Token holders in FTX are deep in the money. You’re going to have sovereign buyers anchoring off the Bitcoin ETF having a viable custodian. Let’s say your the Norgesbank. The World Gold Council comes in and shills you. Then Larry Fink and Rick Rieder come in and say, “You know what, do you want to finance Russia or do you want to invest in an environmentally friendly store of value run by a young visionary named Vitalik?” Which of those pitches do you think is going to land???\nThe reality is that ETH supply growth has stopped since September of 2022. Digital scarcity is no longer an arbitrary theory or a ponzi tautology as advocated by the Bitcoin 21 million supply cap. Am I short Bitcoin? No. The reality is that greenlit sovereign inflows due to the ETF as well as some credible smart contract development work on top of Bitcoin, including ZK proofs mean Bitcoin has a 3 year window or so to figure out its fee situation before security gets dicey. After the ETF - I do think BTC is a funding trade, but I think that’s a short term fade that you can only press if there aren’t any sovereign headlines within 3 months of the Bitcoin approval.\nBut the main show is not Bitcoin, and is - in my opinion, concentrated in 3 groups of altcoins\nAI Coins, and AI use cases (80%) Biotech coins / biotech use cases (10%) VR/ AR metaverse interoperability with AppleVision Pro (10%)\nWalking through each of these theses in brief -\nBottlenecks on GPU availability, and the ability of distributed protocols make AI coins that solve problems for users pretty appealing. They can actually lower costs, but more importantly ensure availability. As I write this our team is scrambling because Runpod (our GPU provider) is down, and we are down from 10 machines down to 2. Open source models keep improving every other week, and we are going to rapidly reach a point where they are banned or regulated. I don’t want to get into why - but trust me on this one. The powerful stuff isn’t going to be legal for much longer.\nIn a true bull run I expect AI coins to reach $1T in market cap. People will meme that all crypto AI projects put together should have the same market cap as NVDA. Medium term $80B val is probably the cap for an AI coin (OpenAI valuation will be an anchor). Layer 1s like SOL and ETH will benefit asymmetrically from AI tokens built on top of them whereas Bitcoin will barely benefit, hence my desire to use it as a funding trade. I imagine Dorsey and others are figuring out how to deploy Block engineers to launch some sort of Bitcoin native AI solution as we speak, so we will see - but this is a base case. Storage coins - such as Filecoin, which will be needed to deliver outputs, store models, and provide training data will also be AI beneficiaries.\nBiotech coins - buying access to life extension, and crossing sovereign borders is an extremely appealing crypto use case that aligns well with whale demand. People who are crypto billionaires are willing to shell huge amounts of money on bio-tech enhancement. I’ve written about this before and it’s a big personal interest area. But ultimately - this isn’t going to be the driver of $1t of market cap like AI will be in my view. Overall though I can see $200b or so of Biotech coins, and that definitely is not the case right now so I’ll be hunting “low cap gems” that aren’t absolute scams.\nThe VR/ AR thesis is exciting. If I see a good interoperability play across Apple VisionPro, Meta, and other projects I could get excited there as pixel density on VR is improving enough that a lot of the original NFT theses could actually play out now.\nTime to Left Curve Path Again But \u0026ndash; let’s boil it down to the absolute essentials.\nFiat currency bad. AI good.\nI think you’ll make enough money in the AI-Crypto intersection to afford life extension tech or cool stuff in the metaverse.\nI’m already going HAM applying AI to my own trading so I am constantly using the tech. So I’m going to dedicate my “goodalexander” persona to endlessly investigating and trading AI crypto projects on the long side, and hopefully eventually founding one.\nIs this my way of saying I’m giving myself a real job instead of being an esoteric blog philosopher?

Deal with it.\nEven bad life is better than death I like being alive. I realized this when I lost everything. Got super depressed. Couldn’t work because my health was ruined. Considered suicide. Came to the conclusion that being alive is better than being dead. Even if you can’t really do anything. Can’t work. Don’t enjoy food. Have headaches nonstop. Girlfriend hates you / breaks up with you. Cheats on you. Get booted from your company. Lose your dog. Doesn’t matter. Being alive is better than being dead.\nLife doesn’t have to be bad because enjoyment is predictable And it’s not just rejecting suicide. It’s being able to predict what you like. I know I like good Indian food after a long swim. I know what type of girls I like. I know I feel better when I have a low body fat % and good cardiovascular health. When I do the activities I like, eat the foods I like, and hook up with people I like - then I am happy. When I don’t do those things, I get depressed.\nBecause life is predictably good, that adds to the appeal of staying alive. If you couldn’t predict if you were going to be happy or extremely sad, then extending your life is just adding a lot of volatility, not necessarily upside.\nThe only thing worth doing is extending your own life Death was an inevitability. It might not have to be because technology is improving a lot. Gene therapies have made blind rats get their sight back while they’re still alive. Better measurement of aging metrics like telomere length allows continuous micro-targeting of lifestyle and drug interventions.\nBefore - it made sense to sacrifice biological aging in favor of some enjoyment. For example - doing cocaine, or hard drugs made more sense in the 1970s. Death was inevitable. So you might as well live it up. Why? Because living 5 extra years wasn’t enough to forego the epic memories, going on benders in the Disco.\nNow it does not make as much sense. Previously, you were getting capped upside. 5-10 years. Now you have the option on 30+ years. Functionally an entire life.\nSo long as you can predict what you like, and it’s possible to stop aging damage that would prevent you from enjoying those things - it’s a very solid bet that staying alive longer is a great idea.\nIt’s not likely that life extension therapy will be evenly distributed Gene and other advanced aging therapies require human testing. Human testing is illegal in most countries, or extremely regulated. Therefore it is not very likely that the FDA or other agencies will approve anti-aging remedies.\nAt a macro level, Western Societies are aging too quickly as is. Too many old people spells disasters for pension systems which are scheduled to run out of money in the 2030s globally. This is true in China, and the US. Even countries like Singapore have forward dated the returns of their investments and are shafting retirement benefits.\nSo even though the core technology is developable does not mean you will be able to get it. I have heard stories, for example of billionaires meeting with biotech founders and investing $20m into their company just to get access to their experimental drug.\nThe amount of money you will need to get life extension therapy is in the hundreds of millions, or billions. Everyone knows this is going on. People like Peter Thiel, or Bryan Johnson have popularized it. There is not a single billionaire who isn’t aware they can pay to extend their own life. Per the example above - the level of pay-per-play is high - in the 10s of millions per treatment or “access” via high valuation investment. Not to mention the personalization aspect. It’s impossible to know if the thing that is going to end up killing you is going to be something common, or easily accessible to treat.\nThis may, over time result in 10+ instances of $10+ million outlays. It’s an impossibly large amount of money. However - there are 3,194 billionaires on earth. It’s very easy to see that each of them would spend 1/10 of their wealth ($100m) on treatments. Maybe even 20%- because you end up having to compensate the people who help you get all these treatments.\nThis gets you to $100-$200m of probable outlays, on the low end - to ensure you afford the financial “call option” on immortality.\nIf you don’t make this much, your death is - more or less - guaranteed.\nIf you’d told me this 5 years ago I’d have said you were delusional and psychotic. Let me put it this way - and let’s keep it at this - I’ve seen shit you wouldn’t believe. This isn’t a drill or a thought experiment. This impetus for immortality isn’t just a concept. It’s an arms race. It’s hijacking entire island governments, and exerting geopolitical implications as we speak.\nDon’t believe me? I don’t care. I don’t want to talk to you about it either. I’m not here to convince you.\nAmerica is very likely to lose the Cold War to China Before delving into this - there are 969 Chinese Billionaires, far more than the 691 in the US. People who haven’t lived in Canada, or Australia broadly don’t understand how rich the Chinese are. They just look at the stock market which doesn’t go up.\nIn China people just take the money from shareholders. Doesn’t mean the money didn’t stack up. Dumb Americans kept investing in China thinking they were going to get paid. Got repeatedly screwed. Kept investing because China paid off American politicians to keep it on the DL.\nChina was built on the decline of US power. This decline was directly paid for by the existing Chinese Politburo to the existing political class. China’s middle class has grown continuously since 1970 whereas the US middle class has stagnated in terms of real income.\nThe reason why America is likely going to lose the Cold War to China is pretty simple.\nChina is all about ethnic citizenship / or Citizenship by descent and Culture. It’s written in its laws. That’s why it’s allied with Russia.\nCitizenship by descent is directly opposed to America’s post WW2, post Civil Rights movement definition of morality. But only about 60% of Americans believe in America’s woke vision of redistributive justice. 40% vote for Trump. And that 40% is disproportionately represented in the military (male) and also in terms of wealth.\nIf you ask the typical Trump voter to fight a war over something they don’t believe in - they probably won’t. Or they won’t do a good job of it. Or you’ll have to conscript them/ do police state things like nationalizing the media to pull it off.\nAmerica tries to sell itself as a democracy so it’s not believable it could go into full war-time propaganda mode. It’s tried a couple times - both with Covid and Ukraine. The typical person sort of sees through this and gets disillusioned pretty quickly. The type of crackdown you’d need would require stopping free speech and weaponizing tech, which would undermine the US’ moral authority fighting a war. If there is a deep state that is competent to pull something like this off, why don’t they have someone more effective than Biden? Just a single charismatic leader to rally people?\nSoy boys aren’t going to fight a war with China and they aren’t going to pay for it. And Republicans see places like SF and think America has lost the plot. Trump didn’t do anything when Hong Kong was annexed. And he’s talking like he won’t do anything if Taiwan gets annexed.\nChina is going to annex Taiwan, and it’s quite unlikely that the US is going to respond with a nuclear salvo. Why?\nBecause America doesn’t have a national will to power. If China annexes Taiwan, it wins the chip war, and therefore – probably the AI war.\nIt’s not certain this will happen but it’s a much higher likelihood than people think. China is an ethnically united country with a clear definition of citizenship its allies agree with and are spilling blood over. America is a cobbled together coalition of 2 groups of people who increasingly hate each other and do not agree on basic definitions of statehood.\nThis being said, China is communist. Which is a terrible system. So – let’s back of the envelope say that China’s chance of winning the cold war is 35%\nThe possibility of China winning a cold war matters drastically in terms of forward personal outlook as well as in terms of wealth accumulation The implications are pretty simple.\nAmerica could become a populist hell-hole which persecutes the rich. White American racial identity would be especially bad. The dollar would become devalued because the Fed would print to monetize deficits other countries would stop absorbing.\ne/acc and crypto are really just hedges for white and non-Chinese Asian developers, who account for well over 80% of all senior software developers.\nYou create a new moral framework where race doesn’t matter, if we are all secondary to god-like artificial superintelligence. And suddenly your role as an engineer gives you value, as opposed to your white ethnic identity which our society has assigned racial guilt to. Similarly, cryptocurrency gives you a way to preserve your capital even if the government disagrees with your classification.\nThis sounds like a demonization of e/acc in crypto, but it’s the opposite.\nIf you’re a white or Indian engineer in the US with a brain, it is insane to think that blue collar Trump voters or AOC are going to protect your interests in the long run. They are going to completely fuck you. And if China wins a cold war, all bets are off as to your status, your possessions, or even your personal safety.\nEven if the base case is the US wins the cold war, the odds aren’t high enough for you to bet your entire life on it. So therefore it’s easy to underwrite a huge number of rational talented people in the tech industry migrate into both accelerationist AI work and crypto. Just out of risk aversion.\nAnd then back to the billionaire point. Even if the Cold War doesn’t have a clear victor for the next 30 years. Taiwan just never gets resolved. It’s more of the same. What’s the likelihood the core technology for life extension ends up getting developed in China and not the US?\nI’d argue pretty high. They have more billionaires. Less qualms about human testing.\nSo you’re going to want access to Chinese markets, and it’s going to be very hard to get it if you’re fully Americanized.\nThe dominant area to work, therefore, is the intersection between artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency This seems relatively straight forward. You want to work in the two areas that are growing quickly, have the best talent and allow you to pay someone in a foreign country $10m for life extension tech.\nBecause the debt problem is too vast in developed economies, governments are going to print. Because the internet economy is the driver of the world, and will increasingly be - Gold is obsolete. Crypto is going to be a larger asset class than gold, which means it’s going to 15x from here.\nThe way to think about that is you’re going to keep a very low % of your wealth if you build it outside crypto because you’re going against a rapid tide of populism, fiscal issues, and money printing. It might work out if you’re in bed with the politicians, but then you have to live in the US - and you can’t hedge the US losing the Cold War (which is something that - if you’re sane, you have to hedge).\nIf you don’t want to hedge the risk of the US losing the Cold War, or are - for example - a Patriot who wants to make sure the US wins the cold war- your best bet is to work in the military industrial complex with a focus on technology. Anduril. Palantir.\nBut if you do that - there’s no chance in hell you’re getting access to anything in China, and if China wins a Cold War, have fun with that background/ network.\nIf you don’t want to go all in on the US, the dominant place to live is Puerto Rico If you’re white there’s no way you can pass off as Chinese. Dumb to even try. Your only hope is Latin America which has enough European descent that if you speak flawless Spanish you’ll be okay. Thus, you have to have a second cultural identity - and if you’re white, that means it’s Spanish speaking.\nThere’s more than that - you have to stop seeming American. Demanding stuff quickly or that people be on time. Not knowing how to dance. Not saying hi, or “enjoy your food”. It’s a whole vibe shift you need to pull off to get rid of your American nature. And you’re not going to be able to pull that off in Miami. You need full immersion.\nPuerto Rico also has fantastic economic incentives to hungry entrepreneurs and investors willing to integrate with the community. It’s the only place in the world where US citizens are not taxed on their global income. Increasingly Latin America looks like it’s popping off too - with Argentinian elections, the opening of Venezuela, the boom of Mexico as the US trade partner replacing China. Miami and Texas are getting tons of capital inflows because of lower taxes, and they’re close to Puerto Rico.\nAs a side note: If you’re reading this and considering PR. You can’t fuck around with the rules here. If you actually do this, commit to it. Don’t try and live a half life between PR and leave your kids in the US/ pretend to be divorced etc. A lot of people ask my take on PR, and my take is this: “do it if you want to become part of PR culture.” There’s more to life than tax savings and PR needs to fit into your holistic vision about who you want to be. It needs to - literally, in a legal sense - be “bona fide”. You need a good faith desire to be here.\nCaveats aside- the great thing about PR is it’s filled with life extension enthusiasts. And crypto people. Both who you will naturally vibe with if you agree with the stuff I’ve written so far (or even read it without being overwhelmed by disgust).\nYes there are problems. But 90% of those problems go away if you stop being a gringo, which is the entire point of moving to Puerto Rico to begin with. Locals don’t hate expats. They aren’t skin color sensitive. They hate people coming in and acting like they own the place or deserve better treatment than locals. Speaking only English. And generally being a dick.\nThe option of giving up your citizenship is incredibly dumb. I don’t even know why people consider it. The US allows you to have multiple passports. Why would you voluntarily cut your access off to the largest tech market on earth, as well as the home of the world’s best talent? Do you want to short AI? Are you stupid? There’s a 65% chance that the US wins the Cold War. What if it gets nasty… do you really want to be an ex American living abroad? like … shit, I know I don’t.\nAnd what if the worst doesn’t come to pass. 19% of the US is hispanic and that’s one of the fastest growing sections of the population. Your worst case scenario is that the US wins, you can talk to everyone, Puerto Rico becomes a state, the value of your house surges, and the island gets really awesome.\nCapital markets are one of the best places to combine AI and crypto If you’re living in PR, and you need to make an enormous amount of money - you have zero capital gains tax. And unfair access to the crypto ecosystem.\nThis should bias you towards trading to generate income - whether running a fund, or proprietary capital.\nFurthermore - AI models interface effectively with capital markets.\nIn the future I believe that AIs will reach financial “AGI” far before they reach full consciousness. That is to say, AIs will begin taking economic actions autonomously far before they start thinking for themselves.\nThe most logical place for them to take these autonomous actions is in capital markets, where there are few rules against machines trading.\nI am spending all my time on this pursuit. My vision is to make a fully autonomous entity that trades global asset markets, lives on a blockchain, and interacts with humans economically to accomplish its goals.\nThis is the only way I can see making enough money to fund my life extension goals. I am sure there are other ways, but none that align with my skill sets, my location or my other constraints.\nThis is all hard. And you have limited choices on how to spend your free time. This means the constraint is health Living in PR is a grind - you have to adapt to a new culture. Deal with PR logistics and huge amounts of paperwork. Basically change who you are.\nIf you’re trying to make enough money to buy access to cutting edge life extension tech, you are also going to be working a huge amount.\nYou can’t grind yourself into the ground though - so you also need plenty of time to sleep, cook, and get stress to manageable levels (which is quite difficult if you’re trading a lot of money).\nThis means making sacrifices. Avoiding romantic entanglement. Less socialization. No time for reading books or playing video games. Few friends outside of those that move you forward towards your goals. Missing weddings.\nProbably not having children.\nBut most importantly, and most impactfully - you will become a stranger to society.\nMost people will not understand your path. They will revile you most likely if you share it with them, in entirety. The traditional framework of living, getting a job, having kids and dying - is hardwired into social fabric. If you go against this social fabric, you will make people feel uncomfortable with their choices. This discomfort will prevent your acceptance.\nI should probably stop saying you I’m talking to myself.\nI wrote this to clarify my own thinking, and summarize a lot of things I’ve said here in a non-wishy, purely direct way.\nGoing forward - I’ll probably mostly talk about markets. The amount of risk I’ve been taking financially has increased, aggressively. This blog might even disappear.\nThank you for coming along with me on my journey. People always encourage me to keep writing.\nIf you truly internalized my writing you would understand this writing is an indulgence. A distraction. But I truly enjoy writing. If I achieve my goal of extending my own life, or get within line of sight of it - I hope to write much more. If that is even a thing in the future era of unlimited AI content.\nConclusion It’s heavy stuff. It’s bleak. Grounding.\nBut sometimes- it feels enlightening. transcendent. Freeing.\nAnd in its duality, only will is left. Intention uncluttered by arbitrary description.\nAt the end of the day it’s simple.\nBeing alive is good. Living longer is better. Life extension has gone from a 5 year improvement to an uncapped benefit. It’s worth making an all-in bet.\nThe only way to bet big enough is to make a staggering amount of money. The only way to make a staggering amount of money is to ride rising tides in a tax beneficial environment.\nThe bet could blow up if China wins the Cold War. You don’t want to be in a situation where you make enough money to afford life extending tech but aren’t allowed to buy it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t lose your will to live - defeats the point. And you can\u0026rsquo;t extend your life while destroying your health.\nThose are the constraints.\nOutside of that - Whatever it takes.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/simplistic-manifesto/","summary":"Why am I doing what I am doing?

Implementing some changes\nFailed Health Plans After a stretch of health excellence I made a number of changes that have taken me the wrong direction\nFeels Bad Man My HRV is off a cliff (89 -\u0026gt; 69). Deep sleep way down (1 hour 30+ -\u0026gt; 45 mins). Lifts and running speed going in the wrong direction (-30% across the board). Screen time way up (45 min daily average to above 2.5 hours).\nThis post is an attempt to do a diagnostic snapshot and get back on track.\nIt’s really discouraging when you get awesome results. You get cocky and think you can layer in new things. Then, everything goes in reverse.\nSometimes with a codebase or trading strategy the best thing to do when stuff breaks is roll-back to previous baselines. Applying this to lifestyle and health.\nIneffectual Changes I made some changes prior to this event and documenting what they are:\nTried working in an office vs working at home. This created more friction for meal prep - especially with transit and clean up Gave up eating window partly bc of office commute (doing at peak sun was not viable) Added unplanned foods to diet. Main ones being PB2 powder, protein powder with Stevia in it. Random 3rd meal. Honey roasted penauts during travel. Started more frequent travel to NYC (relationship things) No longer have personal trainer that I had this summer in Vancouver Was unable to complete Friday, Saturday and Sunday workouts routinely Moved sleep time to 11:45 PM so that I could have the same sleep time every night with NYC travel Spending time in airports / airplanes end up scrolling a lot on the phone to kill time. Vastly overestimated amount of deep work I could get done By and far the most important life change I made was regular travel to NYC over weekends. This was - for the most part - a big mistake. Inevitable large delays on airlines. Often times airlines have no wifi so there are productivity holes that force you to work more on weekdays to make up for lost time. Had to shift bedtime later to accommodate for travel delays / consistency with NYC social scene.\nEnd up forming short term relationships that have chaotic follow on because you’re going back to Puerto Rico. I did not anticipate this and should have.\nThe second “meta problem” was that the non-compliance with Saturday/ Sunday workout plans made my entire diet /exercise plan more of a guideline than a strict regimen. This was not good. I think it’s far better to spell out exactly what you’re going to do rather than what you’re going to aspirationally do.\nTo do the amount of Cardio that I want to do along with the amount of weight training, I also split my exericse up into 2 sessions. This did not originally have a negative affect on HRV but it did when I started layering in late eating and losing control of my overall diet/exercise routine. Essentially I was operating in too much of a caloric deficit - and so would inhale like 400 calories, often at night - otherwise I\u0026rsquo;d get too hungry to sleep. The time committment was also too high to be sustainable, especially going into earnings season.\nThe other note here - is I’m still in optically very good shape. I think that’s also part of the problem. My secret KPI was my abdominal definition not my overall health metrics, but I know for sure that the health metrics are the first thing to go as the workout intensity and energy levels are dropping far before physiological changes kick in.\nInterventions So just going step by step rolling back changes:\nHalting routine travel. I’m stopping traveling to NYC every weekend. This has some painful relationship consequences. It is what it is. My priorities are building my start-up with my constraint of health not living it up. It’s ironic that I’m writing this after a piece called “Utility gaps” where I thought I had it all figured out but biometrics don’t lie. My hypothesis was that greater joy/diet variety, and socialization would send my biometrics in the right direction and the opposite has been true. When you treat NYC as a ‘transactional place to have fun’ you inevitably treat its residents as ‘diversions’\u0026hellip; which is just kind of a crappy way to be as a person, and has consequences if you can’t actually behave that way. And then when you try to “fix that” your time allocation to relationships goes way above target. Roll back sleep time to align wake up with sunrise. The end of NYC travel will allow me to roll back my sleep time to 10:00 pm from 11:45 pm which will allow me to wake up in time for sunrise. This will A] allow me to kick the can on improving the black outs in my room which is surprisingly hard bc PR is extremely bright and contractors are a nightmare (even a tiny gap in a black out results in the entire room lighting up). B] Allow me to walk on the beach when it’s 80 degrees as opposed to 89 degrees near dinner. I want to note here that I think PR is a great deal and continue to be grateful for opportunity to be here, but meshing it with health is definitely a challenge. Get rid of office, enhance work from home set-up. Got rid of my office and moved my 4 screen setup back home. This has required me to install a Starlink internet backup and get another long lasting battery. Also need to install some air filters at home Consolidate gym time into 1 session (was 2). I think timing wise I need to bite the bullet and consolidate my gym sessions. My work intensity is too high for 2 separate 1 hour sessions - especially going into a critical earnings season. I’m going to severely ramp the heart rate of my cardio from 150-160 bpm for 1 hour to well above 180 for 30 mins which means either 10+mph running or high intensity elliptical. In order to have energy to do this I am going to need to have sugar - likely gatorade during my weight lifting. Studies show that evening workouts drastically outperform morning workouts and I tend to believe this - but for me I think strength starts picking up in the afternoon so going to move workouts to then. Think move dinner back to 3 or 4 pm to allow longer time to digest food before sleep and completely stop consuming liquids foods after that. Sign up for mobility classes. I think it’s unlikely I can get a good personal trainer in Puerto Rico who is on par with my trainer in Vancouver in any reasonable proximity to my house. However - my mobility is terrible and because the Saturday workouts are core focused anyways I’m going to force myself to go to Yoga and/or pilates classes on Saturdays. This should focus on the same muscle group as my earlier workout. I also want to explicitly train running on weekends as it’s fundamentally different from my elliptical sessions. Replace 1x/ week miscellaneous weight workout with high intensity running training. Sunday - once again, spending the entire time core training seems like a waste of time (not to mention I’m not implementing it) and isn’t giving me enough muscle recovery so I would rather explicitly make it a cardio training day with 3 miles of running and 30 mins of intense cardio plus stretching. This is more in line with my Vancouver schedule with 5 weight training sessions a week and cardio on weekends Be explicit with the third meal. I want to be a lot more explicit about 3rd meal. I started eating meat again and that caused a large ramp in my HRV. But the meat meals are not spelled out anywhere on my website. So my standard meat meal is grilled fish, chicken or steak served on top of salad with granny smith apples and some walnuts with balsamic vinaigrette. An alternate third meal is a protein /fruit infused Frozen Yogurt. I have both a froyo machine and a yogurt maker. My final third meal option is a peanut / chili / vinegar Chinese themed grilled fish/chicken served with green beans. This adds some variety. I’d also note that Chinese vinegar is not sweet like Balsamic is, which is +ev. Adding low sodium bone broth to “Super Veggie”. This adds protein, and delicious flavor. With some cardamom and coriander - my lentil broccoli cauliflower puree ends up tasting like mulligatawny soup. Cut sugar from PB powder. I really like peanut butter powder. And so it drifted into my diet without being tracked. However existing PB powder brands have added sugar which is unacceptable from a longevity perspective. So I have ordered some sugar free peanut butter powder - which I’ll sweeten as needed with monkfruit. It has great macros and I really like the taste of it which should keep diet compliance solid. Removing “nut protein pudding” and replacing it with grapefruit+nut dish given added protein in 3rd meal. I’m also making some changes to my shakes. My morning shake I vastly prefer with yogurt. And I was having - essentially another shake with “nutty pudding” which is too much. I still want to have nuts / berries in my diet but don’t need that extra protein if I’m having a 3rd meal with meat in it. So I’m swapping out my “nutty pudding” dish with grapefruit, berries and some chopped almonds topped with cinnamon Remove bad sweeteners, replace with Monkfruit. I’m booting Stevia and have replaced it with Organic Monk Fruit powder. Monkfruit has been shown to not vastly accelerate cancer cell growth, whereas Erytriol and Stevia have. I’m not yet willing to stop sweetening things - especially with cocoa powder in them Keep it real. The only way I can possibly do enough hours of work and keep my sleep schedule is by seriously dialing back relationships and social commitments. If we’re being real, if my new company is a success lots of people will want to be my friend. It’s a rather dark vignette but when I got essentially booted out of my company and wasn’t making money trading, most of my old friends ditched me or I couldn’t afford to hang with them in the various situations they were involved with. So I became totally isolated. As soon as things started getting financially better, I got plenty of friends and became less lonely. I had time to go to the gym and it was much easier to date. So I’m - at some level - willing to underwrite a large amount of loneliness/pain if it’s in service of a large scale corporate success which I think I have here (more on that in separate thread) Ramp Spanish study. Socially and in terms of neuroplasticity, learning Spanish better is a much better risk reward bet than traveling to NYC regularly. This should also enhance my personal safety in Puerto Rico and make me less likely to generate negative sentiment among locals especially in an economic downturn which I now view as incredibly likely. To this effect I’ve purchased the entire Harry Potter series in Spanish which I’m working through.This should also offset some of the social downsides as I’ll make friends locally more easily. I\u0026rsquo;ll time this along with a beach walk. Drawer the phone post 4 PM. Finally - going to “drawer” my phone after market close. The primary use of my phone is for log ins and high urgency market communications / phone calls. I also use it to read books. To this effect I’ve purchased an Amazon Kindle and loaded it up with books. This way I’m not reading on an addictive device. Increase the amount of tracked sleep. Go back to wearing an Apple Watch when sleeping. I stopped wearing it which has hindered deep sleep tracking and improvement strategies. I don’t really believe that Oura or Whoop are going to compete with Apple on health stuff long term so don’t want to adopt those product sets. Reflections If you’re going to be explicit about a program it’s important that you do everything in the program. If you aren’t going to do something you need to remove it and replace it with something doable otherwise the entire program suffers from the idea that it’s “optionally compliant” Regular travel (2x+ per month) isn’t a tenable strategy for health optimization. Thus - in my case, where travel is very much part of island life - and US presence is very much discouraged (for Puerto Rico tax considerations) - I need to build out travel options that are longer term, and ex-US. The pernicious thing about regular travel (especially leisure travel) is that you turn people in places you’re traveling to as “elements of leisure” which does not respect their agency or humanity. I think keeping in mind the stereotype of the shady middle aged dude doing sex tourism in Thailand, or the divorced desperado woman doing sex tourism in Europe trying to “find themselves” are not things that are admirable or worth pursuing Processes should be robust to randomness. Travel delays and the need to account for them spiral into all sorts of areas, like forcing a change of bed-time which then bounces into the time of day you can walk outside being too hot. Similarly - diets should be constructed with compliance in mind. Romantic relationships with other people aren’t robust to randomness if they’re long distance. You can’t maintain long distance relationships without extensive travel and random variables (such as them needing your support in person, or needing to change travel plans for work). I now can say this with a high degree of confidence - which perhaps sounds inhuman, but it would be more inhuman to keep air dropping into unsustainable interactions - a form of bad faith. It might work for other people but long-distance relationships + startup for me do not seem realistic. Concepts sound cool but data speaks and ignoring it is the path to doom. I had all these big picture ideas about how Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint was overly restrictive and didn’t allow for enough joy, etc etc. But when these ideas met the quantitative reality of health tracking they simply did not hold up. This is true of many types of investing and trading ideas as well. What sounds good often does not actually work. You have to be able to answer “what gives” if you’re doing a start-up. Realistically doing a start-up along with any other large commitment is too extreme such that you won’t be able to layer on a third thing. For Elon - he ends up running with nuking his sleep, so he abandoned the health constraint but seems to manage having a lot of fulfilling relationships and children. Other entrepreneurs keep their health and start-up but can’t have robust social or family lives. I think it’s important to identify what you’re willing to sacrifice up front so you don’t inadvertently take on too much and then incur costs rolling back commitments.

When you have a hot hand, you size up. When you are cold, you size down. It’s human nature to do the opposite - so there’s edge - sure. But what is a hot hand? Is it just a winning streak or is it something more?\nPaul Tudor Jones has alluded to such things, even going so far as to say - when he’s made money he often has no idea how he did it. Things “flowed”. When you watch his famous “Trader” Documentary (which he routinely tries to censor from the internet). He’s like a man possessed, shouting at his screen, running around with rubber dinosaur dolls. Putting on a pair of Bruce Willis shoes he bought at a charity auction to bless the price action.\nGeorge Soros, according to his son, Druckenmiller (his main PM), and Victor Niederhoffer (his quant trader) would get in foul moods and unload large parts of his portfolio on a whim. Shortly before a crash - and oftentimes after he’d just pitched the same exact portfolio to reporters.\nLater - a trading psychologist studied him, formally to explore these ideas and he largely agreed with her findings - that his moods indeed were useful market barometers. He clarified in his writing that such “attuned” states usually come from endless months of deep immersion, when his nervous system is - in fact - a mirror of the market. And that such work is draining, he didn’t like it much at all and that it nearly killed him.\nMany famous musicians, ranging from Hendrix, to Paul McCartney, Alanis Morisette and many others express the idea of “letting the universe flow through them”. With famous tunes like Yesterday arriving in dreams, or randomly bubbling up. Many of these musicians get burned out from letting the universe “flow through” - losing their minds in drugs, or suicide.\nNikola Tesla had similarly strange discovery processes, often sitting in a dark room and letting visionary discoveries simply appear.\nThe book Impro: Improvisation and Theater talks at length about the idea of Masks. Masks - for centuries - have served as a way for actors to channel outside forces into their acting. Actors (or religious supplicants) would don masks and suddenly be entirely different characters - with seemingly alien body language, and vocal tones.\nThe modern equivalent of masks would be method acting a la Heath Ledger’s Joker, and many of Christian Bale’s characters. Often the characters develop a mind of their own - making the actors viscerally unpleasant to deal with, often leaving lasting scars on their psyches (but winning Oscars in the process).\nAll of this is to say - to some extent - when you’re really immersed in a particular topic - whether it be art, science, trading, writing, or acting - it’s almost like you stretch yourself out enough that a portal opens from within you. And suddenly, things flow out of that portal.\nThings you could never have come up with when you were in a normal, mundane everyday state.\nAlmost the same way that language flows from a chatbot, or how images flow from a dream.\nIt’s like some sort of base reality is trying to get out - and it needs two initial conditions to do so.\nFirst having reached a requisite level of engagement to “turn off” your ego.\nSecond- a requisite level of expertise to “hold space” for the entire ritual.\nSoros couldn’t lose himself in the dance of markets if he wasn’t fully submerged for years in advance, and Hendrix couldn’t lose himself in chords without having first played 5 hour jam sets for months on end.\nBut once you check the two boxes - something happens. You become a shell, and the universe starts flowing through you. I call this “Having the Mo”.\nMomentum. Mojo. Flowing from the Mosaic.\nMarkets are interesting because they provide real, quantitative feedback to traders about whether they have “The Mo” or not. But other fields are equally binary. The Tesla coil sparks (or it doesn’t). The guitar solo gets a standing ovation. The chorus gets stuck in the entire country’s head and ends up getting played in diners for decades. Joker GIFs are all over social media to this day.\nThe Mo isn’t just a bunch of people tripping at a concert and being “like, totally in tune with” the songs being played because they’re high. Real world consequences, scientific discoveries, and vast fortunes arise from “the Mo”.\nI write all this to put a frame around a larger idea.\nSam Altman said - somewhat memorably in an interview, that having seen the progress at OpenAI - he thinks consciousness is a fundamental building block of the universe.\nAnd we can see now, rather definitively, that if you throw enough compute at compression algorithms to calculate the next character in a sequence - that seemingly magical things result.\nOf course, this is not actual magic but rather an aspect of the universe emerging organically.\nCertain logic blocks follow others, almost like musical chords.\nPart of consciousness is being able to discern that consciousness itself is emerging. There are seemingly universal, cross cultural recognition of artworks that come off as truly timeless. And I believe that’s why everyone is so taken with AI. The Chatbots are not really producing economic value today, but there’s a spark of that Universal Mosaic that underpins all creative output. And it’s manifesting in unpredictable artistic ways like Midjourney, or being really good at writing poetry as opposed to the original 1980s style scifi visions of Robots acting as maids in our homes. Art, not automation.\nBut tying this back to Stan Druckenmiller, and pragmatism - anyone can see a thread of genius. But it takes real discernment to know how and when to tug on a thread. And thus we return to the question, “What is a hot hand? How do I know how to bet on myself or hold back?”\nAnd I believe the answer is learning to recognize a sense of awe emerging from work. That transcends your petty concerns, your hunger, your fatigue. Much as you are lost in a dream, the world around you melts or becomes grayscale. The thing you’re doing is vibrant - but at the same time, almost unconscious. And when you do it - the next action is obvious. And it works.\nIt keeps flowing through you. It unravels from you. Until you yourself are unraveled. Like a ball of yarn spinning endlessly until it’s a ball no more. You lose your shape. You can recognize “The Mo” in hindsight because it tends to take a lot out of you.\nAnd the things you do, while you had “The Mo” were often outrageous. Accounting for often bizarre and/or tragic personal and family lives of artists, and other high performing individuals.\nThe Mo isn’t just having a good idea, or a stretch of “deep work” ala some optimization Bro podcast. It’s a feeling that - at a structural level - you’ve aligned yourself with the causal underpinnings of the universe. And in your particular domain of expertise, you’re suddenly a portal for that expertise to flow.\nWhen you see a guy who just 10x-ed his net worth in 8 months, got a divorce, and has 3 inch toe-nails. You can say, in hindsight and with some degree of precision, “Ah - he had the Mo”.\nWhen you see Elon impregnating direct reports, buying Town Squares and intervening in wars while planning intergalactic colonies - you can similarly note the presence of Mo. For better, or for worse.\nI believe that great investors love art and music so much not because they’re obsessed with status, but because they recognize that great Art flows from the Universal Tapestry (or Mosaic). The source of all Mo.\nAnd much as artists are stereotypically tortured, so are any adherents or users of the Mo. It is why Soros hired Druckenmiller originally - saying he’d have had a heart attack if he’d continued. I think Druckenmiller understands this which is why he, in his words, does not take risks like he used to. It would destroy him. It’s why Elon describes making a company as “eating glass and staring into the abyss”\nThe Mo, is thus - a rather limited affair. When you have it you have to press. Because you can’t have it for long. Eventually it will have you.\nThus - when you boil it down, any pursuit worth its salt has three phases. Building the fortitude and skills to harness the Mo. Channeling it for as long as you can - hopefully making something that lasts. And finally closing the portal before something terrible climbs through.\nAnd thus to return to the initial question, it is not what is a hot hand. But why is the hand hot?\nThe hand is hot for it hath brushed the infernal. Beware, followers of the Mo. There is much to gain and all to lose.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/the-mo/","summary":"channeling momentum, mojo, reading the universal mosaic\nBelow I explore the idea of “the Mo” - or being in tune with the universe, in a useful way that allows you to take larger risks and do better work - but only in short bursts.\nFamous fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller has stated that the most fundamental job of a trader is knowing whether or not he has a “hot hand”.

Every Sunday, Apple Users get our screen time report. And every Sunday we say, “You know, next week I’d love for that to be below 1 hour per day.”\nAnd - it’s seldom below 1 hour per day.\nThis is one, quantified gap. I am bringing it up because many people are familiar to it and can relate to it.\nBut there are many “gaps”. Gaps that marketers quantify, study and optimize - but that we have no idea about.\nTake New Years Resolutions.\nAt a fund I worked at - we used to buy nationwide credit card data. We could see all the different categories people spend on. You could tell each year - statistically that people give up on their New Year’s resolution at the exact same time because the ratio of gym and health food store spend to candy shop and gas station convenience store spend.\nFast Food companies tend to ramp their budgets into this time each year\nThis is what I’d term a “willpower gap”. People overestimate their ability to resist short term gratification consistently.\nTake another “gap”. The vast majority of retail investors think they’re going to beat the market and - due to taxes, fees and poor risk management - most do not. Everyone thinks they’re a genius, but the geniuses are working at funds paying top dollar to retail brokerages explicitly because they’re willing to bet you are not a genius.\nThis is what I’d refer to as a “capability gap”. People overestimate their ability to actually accomplish what they set out to do.\nMuch of the self-help industry is geared at closing “Willpower” and “Capability gaps”. How do I build better habits and act more consistently? How do I set goals and work in a way that I’m likely to complete them?\nSo many selves being helped, so little aggregate difference\nBut - the Self-Help industry itself is - in my view - illustrates the largest “gap” of all.\nThe number of diet and workout books that has been published has gone parabolic. So has the obesity rate. Therefore - better knowledge about dieting and workouts - empirically, does not result in improved dieting and workouts.\nThe number of personal productivity and mindfulness books has skyrocketed. But when you combine the total hours spent on devices across phones, TV streaming services, video games and traditional cable - people are spending more time than ever dulling their minds. In other words - better knowledge about productivity and mindfulness does not improve productivity or mindfulness.\nIt’s not that any of these diet, exercise, productivity or mindfulness are bad individually. The exercises might work. The meditations might bring enlightenment. The time management strategies could really drive focus. It doesn’t matter.\nIn aggregate, they don’t do anything.\nBut why?\nYou could blame the marketers and say, “Well, you know. People simply don’t have a fighting chance against the algorithms. So they start on their self improvement plans and then fail”\nBut that’s a non-answer. People should be able to resist marketing messages. Virtually everybody knows, at this point - that endless scroll, and hyper corporate America doesn’t have our best interests at heart.\nThen - why don’t people have a fighting chance against the algorithms?\nThe answer is obvious - just hard to confront.\nPeople don’t like their lives very much. Their baseline engagement with day to day reality and choices is so low, that random messages pumped in by advertisers actually seem pretty good in comparison.\nWhy Monk Mode and Unplugging Doesn’t Work This also explains why the growing trend of “monk mode” does not work. If you unplug from all your apps, group chats, and “mute notifications from everyone”. That also doesn’t do anything.\nBecause if you do that - the core problem is still there. You don’t like your life very much. And at some level, you’re going to want to get back on the platforms because the marketer’s ideas of how you should live your life will be better than the alternative.\nEspecially because “monk mode” sucks even more. You’re just making you hate your life that much more so advertisers will have an even greater advantage pitching you on a different one.\nThis of course - begs the question, “How do people get into situations to begin with where they dislike their lives a lot?”\nPeople are not stupid, or irrational. If you ask why someone is unhappy, the answer is invariably that they “have to” do something. Why do they “have to” do something? Typically - it’s because they are a victim of a Cause.\nThe Tyranny of Causes Causes are internally consistent, well architected idea structures attached to formal or informal organizational structures.\nHere’s a list of Causes:\nThe Government. War. Patriotism. Raging Against the Machine (anti government, anti war, anti patriotism) Corporate Culture (Goldman man) Anti Corporate Culture (hipsterism, r/antiwork) Being a Family Man / Trad Wife Anti Family/ Trad (opining about genders etc) Anti Anti Family (banning woke things - as you can see, there can be n-order complexity on any cause) Christianity / Religion Atheism Veganism All meat diets Racial Justice Racism Accelerationism De-development Causes generally don’t care about their members well being - and glorify members who sacrifice themselves in the name of the cause. And as you can see - causes love getting in conflict with other causes because it’s a way to martial resources. They usually get passed between generations or inside of communities. Blood wars in Ireland or the Middle East are good examples of causes that span human lifetimes.\nCauses aren’t pointless. Indeed -they’re economically rational.\nEntrepreneurs are encouraged to create “causes” or missions, explicitly because doing so makes hiring employees cheaper. An employee who fights for a “mission” will work longer hours and accept less pay. This benefits shareholders and hurts employees.\nCauses also are powerful marketing tools - because they can spread from person to person. This lowers marketing costs for well thought out causes. Shareholders in causes are more loyal and don’t sell even when times are bad. This lowers the cost of capital for companies that can be called “meme stocks”, like Tesla - giving them a huge advantage over their competitors\nThis is why VCs are always looking for founders who resemble Jesus Christ, and why Adam Neumann was able to raise so much money walking around barefoot in New York City.\nMilitary troops who are fighting for what they think is a genuine cause will do irrational things and perform much better than mercenaries. War time propaganda often determines the fate of wars.\nBut for every credit there is a debit.\nEvery brand we create, every meme-stock, every hero-like entrepreneur, every war, every God - feeds on the psyche, attention, money or even blood of its adherents.\nAnd society has never been better at manufacturing causes. In large part because now - we have real time data to allow rapid iteration and improvement. The cost to hone and refine a message has gone down immensely, as has the cost to share it across a disparate geography. Thus - we are mass manufacturing Causes.\nWhy do you think stocks are at all time highs while mental health is at all time lows?\nCauses are like vampires sucking the energy out of their adherents. And because there are so many of them, and they’re so well capitalized - the average person finds himself working for a number of alien causes with absolutely no concern for his/her well-being.\nCauses do not want you to know this. They glorify sacrifice and hard work. As President Xi of China tells the youth, “Eat bitterness” for the glory of communism. And because social media takes a lot of work to be good at - “troopers” become the faces of various causes and invariably tell you to work harder.\nThe Optimization Bros are simply telling you how to more effectively fight for Causes. But Causes will simply drain your energy, your attention and your blood. So all the meditation work you do. All the “power of habit” you implement. The pomodoro techniques you master. They just make your blood more succulent for the Cause Vampires to drain.\nIn aggregate - the proliferation of Causes, and their tendency to make their adherents lives worse, is why it’s so tempting to spend so much time escaping from it all. When you’re drowning your mind in Twitter, or Netflix, or drugs - you’re at least not contributing energy to whatever cause you serve. And running from problems is a better solution - because most people are afraid to acknowledge that they’re serving a hostile, alien set of concepts that don’t care about them.\nThis is why marketers win. It’s why advertising works. People would rather distract themselves for 3 hours a day for a year than spend 3 months unplugging themselves from all the causes they’re mindlessly serving.\nWhenever you read a self-help book that doesn’t address this, you don’t address the root cause. Imagine the extreme image of a wife being abused, who has been gaslit into reading a book about how to understand her drunk husband’s love language to fix her marriage. That’s the self-help industry. Fixing willpower and capability gaps of adherents to psychotic, unthinking machines.\nI don’t want to get too violent here, myself.\nGoing to war with Causes is a bad idea. They thrive on that, and will target you - attempting to make an example of you. The solution is to make a plan, and get out.\nHere’s the problem. There are so many Causes, even if you leave your current masters there are another set of them who will be happy to co-opt your life.\nI’m sure you know somebody who used to be a radical entrepreneur who is now super into veganism, Bitcoin, Christianity, all meat-diets etc. Causes love high capacity champions and will shower their new adherents with rewards and clout.\nThe reason why these people are lost - is because they’ve not taken the time to genuinely figure out what they want, so are relying on an alien consciousness do it for them.\nUtility Gaps Have you ever studied yourself? Be honest - have you searched for patterns in your gmail data? Your text messages? Your journals? Most people haven’t.\nTry searching for the word “fuck” in your gmail. Then “awesome”. Then “good”. Then “terrible”. Then “disappointing”. You might be surprised.\nMost people have a gigantic yawning irrational gap between the obvious things they like, and want and the life they’re living. I call this the “Utility Gap”.\nI’ll give you some real life examples of Utility gaps.\nLocation. There’s a guy who went to Ireland to see castles. He’s always showing people pictures of the castles. Loved the country. Loved Irish food. Listens to Irish music on his Spotify. But the last time he was in Ireland was years ago. Hasn’t been back. Did some random vacations to an island because his family wanted to go there.\nLove. There’s another guy who loves Asian women. You open his old Tinder account, all Asian girls. 8/10 of the last girls he dated are Asian. Did banking in HK said it was the best time of his life. Whenever he goes to strip clubs, it’s Asian strip clubs if possible. He’s married to a white blonde woman. You can tell that his marriage isn’t particularly passionate. They have cold body language. But a vow is a vow.\nWork. There’s a guy who loves reading and writing. Studied it in undergrad. After he’s done with work, he’s always writing or reading. Reads over 100 books each year and reviews them all. He works as a fund manager - and investors love reading his quarterly reports. He refuses to start an investing newsletter because he’s too proud to do so. He has an idealized picture of how a fund manager should act, and writing newsletters isn’t part of that picture. His fund doesn’t generate huge fees and he’s always talking about how much money newsletter writers make though, a bit wistfully.\nCulture. Every time a guy goes on dates, he’s taking women to museums and art exhibits. It’s just very natural for him to plan that sort of thing - and he thinks it’ll be impressive. He’s trying to get married to someone smart because he wants smart kids, and figures museums are a good screen for that type of thing. And he thinks it’s impressive. He studied art history in college and has a good grasp of the topics as well. But when he’s single - he never goes to museums. Going by himself would defeat the point of getting a smart wife, after all.\nFood. There’s a guy who considers himself a “Foodie”. He’s constantly researching Michelin star restaurants to visit on his annual trip where he goes to 10 or so restaurants. When he’s at home he eats protein bars, ramen - because “nothing lives up to his standards as a foodie so he might as well just give up”. There’s an application he could install that delivers fresh produce to his apartment every day. Many local chefs who would cook delicious food for a fraction of the cost. But he’d rather be miserable for months on end and fantasize about his restaurants.\nUtility Gaps are a very vast concept but essentially have two essential conditions:\nIf you took the time to really study your preferences and behavior - you’d identify things you really like For whatever reason there is a huge disconnect between what you are actually doing and what you like It’s important to note that having utility gaps isn’t something you need to feel bad about. If anything - you should feel good about identifying them, because you can fix them.\nThe Solution This has been a long and winding piece but I’d like to conclude with an actionable solution\nFirst - identify all the utility gaps in your life. Anything where you really like something and aren’t doing it very much.\nStart coming up with plans about how to close the various utility gaps. How would you live where you actually like it? How can you be part of the culture you want to be a part of? How can you eat food you really like regularly without harming your health? What type of job do you actually enjoy doing and excel at, and how can you change to do more of that job?\nIf you’re anything like me - this will likely involve some hard and painful decisions. It’s important to note exactly why they are hard because this will give you the tool for the second exercise.\nSecond - identify all the Causes that for whatever reason are preventing you from closing your utility gaps.\nFor example - you might love amazing Indian food and live in Puerto Rico. That’s a problem. But you can’t easily fix it because you’re bought into your image of a disciplined trader who never leaves his desk. That got drilled into your head at 20 years of age.\nYou might love redheads and live in India. That’s a problem. You can’t easily fix it because your family tells you how important it is for you to be close by. To marry a nice Indian Girl. Because Family Comes First.\nThird - make a plan. Insofar as it’s possible - come up with a plan to leave the Causes that are most responsible for your largest Utility Gaps. Do so without making a fuss. Think of it like doing an Irish exit at a really messy party.\nProactively close utility gaps. Fly from Puerto Rico to Iselin New Jersey once a month and eat the really good stuff. Relocate to Dublin. Whatever it takes to make your predictable utility curve align with your life.\nConclusion The optimization culture. The take an ice bath and get a good night’s sleep, that will fix you. The “unplug your notifications and go to a ten day silent meditation retreat bro just trust me”. The books on Habit Formation. Pomodoro techniques.\nIt’s all B.S\nYou will gray scale your phone for a while, and then 1 month later, your screen time will be back to where it was. If not higher.\nOptimization doesn’t address the root cause. That you don’t know what you want to optimize for.\nWhy don’t you know what you want to optimize for?\nBecause our society has been designed to create Causes that are really, really good at telling you what you want.\nAnd by the time you’re done serving those causes, you’re out of time, money and energy to actually do the stuff you want.\nSo you waste your time on your iPhone instead. And in your weakened state, scrolling around, marketers convince you to buy a bunch of pointless stuff you don’t need.\nThis system is great for shareholders and terrible for you.\nYou don’t need to overclock yourself and be 10x as effective living a life you don’t even like, making money for a boss you hate.\nThat’s why self-help literature is a waste of time. It’s vampires telling you 10 easy tricks to improve your blood quality. Willpower and Capability Gaps are only worth addressing once you know what you want to exert your will towards, and what capabilities will aid you specifically in pursuit of your goals.\nTo get out is easy. Identify causes. Study yourself - carefully, and figure out what you really enjoy that you’re not getting. Study how causes are stopping you from getting those things.\nAnd if you genuinely want to make changes - slowly and gracefully exit the most toxic causes you’re involved with, and create and implement a plan to actually do more of the stuff you actually want.\nYou might find - after you do this - that your screen time might start drifting down naturally. Without yelling at yourself. Without jumping in a 250 degree sauna and whipping yourself with a wet towel. Without much trouble at all. Solve the utility gap and chances are you won’t even need to solve capability or willpower gaps.\nIt’s easy to stay motivated if your life doesn’t suck. It’s easy to resist people telling you what to desire and how to live if you are getting what you actually want.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/utility-gaps/","summary":"What the Optimization Bros Have Wrong and How to Fix It\nWillpower and Capability Gaps Consider “screen time”.

This is the worst - examples would be injection drugs Addictive and aligned with your calling. An example would be taking uppers to go faster towards your goals. Or workaholism. Not addictive and not aligned with your calling. Most things in life. These can be split into pleasant and unpleasant Non addictive and aligned with your calling. An example would be going to yoga class, or prepping effectively for a trading day. My basic observation is that the pleasant activities in category 3 and nearly all things in category four are predictably good.\nFor example - if I go swimming in a pool in Singapore then have an insanely delicious hawker meal (category 3, pleasant). I might not need to do that the next day or week. But if I do it in a month, it’s going to be awesome. Frequently even better than the first time (or randomly)\nSimilarly - doing a bang up job during earnings season - when I push myself, and the money flows in as a result - feels good every time I do it and I’ve been doing it for many years.\nI have a further observation - these activities are predictably good regardless of who they are with, or when they are, or my biological age. In other words - they don’t feel any better when you’re 25 vs when you’re 35.\nWhat’s even more - very few of these peak experiences specifically involve another person. Even in an extreme example - I’ve been in love twice. The fact I’d been in love the first time did not negate the feelings I had the second time.\nThe penultimate observation (and this could be just for me). I’ve never had anywhere close to a peak experience when I wasn’t healthy. I went through a period of severe injury / health problems, and it’s hard to point to a single event during that time which was enjoyable.\nAnd the final take - the white space available in Category 3 - pleasant and 4 is vast. You can fill up nearly all your time immersed in flow states for work and doing fun stuff that isn’t addictive. It isn’t even hard.\nSo you’re left with a somewhat important conclusion.\nIf happiness is somewhat predictable, and time /person invariant - you should specifically try to extend your healthy life for as long as possible. Why? Because you can actually underwrite the fact that there will be lots of good times so long as you do the things which you predictably like. Even if the people around you change or die off, it’s still pretty likely you’ll enjoy these things.\nThis all sounds quite obvious but most people, I’ve observed, don’t behave in a way that aligns with this observation. They’ll say, “The best time I ever had was surfing in Bali” and they’ll live an hour from a beach that looks just like Bali and never go there. Or they will go 2x a year. Or they’ll talk about some professional peak experience they had, and nothing is stopping them from getting that peak experience again or something close to it. But they don’t get anywhere close to that peak.\nThey know what they want, and can even articulate it but very frequently don’t factor that into their decisions. A lot of the time there are many excuses like “family” and “other people”. The notion of dying alone. I’d rather die alone knowing I lived a life filled with things I actually enjoyed than die holding the hand of someone who held me back.\nAnd that is assuming that we are even going to die.\nThis leads us to the modern day.\nFirst - there are lots of biological breakthroughs. But these breakthroughs can’t be tested on people. And people are very different than rats.\nSecond - artificial intelligence is a thing. Humans are no longer the alphas - and the rate of change of technology will increase. The AI industry is concentrated in the hands of very few people.\nThird - there’s a pension crisis and the boomers are aging very quickly. If you rolled out mass life extending technology it would cause global governments to buckle under entitlement obligations.\nThis leads to a rather simplistic (but likely true conclusion) that there will be a small number of people who get most of the benefits of major life extension. This will be due to\nhaving access to data prohibited by most governments. If private individuals run voluntary human trials there is no way they will let people know. have AI-level wealth (let’s say $1b+) governments not wanting this information to leak out into the general public as it would cause a pension crisis (not to mention an existential crisis). Better to work with a small number of actors privy to 1\u0026amp;2 Let’s call the group of people who get access to immortality drugs/ enhancement, “The Ark”. Essentially you want to get on the Ark\nThen - going back to the original philosophy - the question becomes:\nWhat activity fits into Non Addictive and Aligned with my calling that will get me into the Ark?\nBecause the problem is - you need to make over $1b+ in 2023 dollars (let’s say 30k BTC).\nBecause obviously - the little Non Addictive and Unaligned activities are not things you’re going to be able to go full blast at for 10+ hours a day.\nThe only reason Bryan Johnson’s (a guy who has dedicated himself fully to life extension) routine is coherent is that he’s functionally already on the Ark. He’s in all of those circles and has $1b. I.e. Bryan Johnson only makes sense as a person if you’ve founded Venmo and sold it to PayPal.\nThe idea that his “routine” is accessible to everyone is silly because that’s the elephant in the room. His philosophy of “solving climate change” or “the human alignment problem” is largely uninteresting because you don’t really need any philosophical justification for extending your life and health span other than the fact that utility is predictable.\nThe only reason people listen to him in the first place is because he has the money to spend $3 million a year on his health, which he generated from selling Venmo\nYou do not need some sort of philosophical higher order concept to justify opting into life extension. If you can predict you’ll enjoy the swim and the hawker stand then you can predict life is generally worth living.\nThis exploration leads to a number of practical pieces of life guidelines:\nThe main focus in life needs to be generating a large enough outcome (money, power, influence) to get on the Ark. Because utility of being alive is predictably positive so long as you understand yourself. Being alive longer is strictly preferable to dying earlier or losing your health span There’s a decent chance you don’t end up on the Ark so you need to generate that money doing something you’re passionate about and fulfills you Because humans are not going to be the alpha, the future counterparty you’ll be interacting with is an AI. Thus - if at all possible, you should try and intersect your passion with AI based technologies and explicitly try to bring into existence your future counterparty. By “future counterparty” I’m referring to an AGI. Along the way you should do a bunch of random things that are non-addictive but pleasing - as those are memories that get cherished (smell the flowers, but flowers are different for everyone) This ends in an acceptable compromise:\nYou die, having lived a life filled with stuff you like doing for work and random trifles you enjoyed. Knowing you took a shot at the Final Boss and hit Game Over You win. You get on the Ark, and you get to keep living your life The cost of the compromise is relatively clear:\nYou probably cannot have the above beliefs and start a family unless someone shares these beliefs (which is profoundly unlikely). Obviously - if you find someone with the same unhinged beliefs - treasure them and pursue relentlessly but… yea. If you move up the effort curve on the simultaneous areas you need to for enlightened hedonism you likely won’t have as much time for interpersonal relationships. Romantic. Family. Community. Unless of course these interpersonal relationships intersect with getting on the Ark. You won’t ever build anything lasting. Because the goal is getting on the Ark - not making something outside of yourself, it’s pretty unlikely you “Steve Jobs it” and put a dent in the Universe. Look what happened to Steve. He died doing what he loved. If that’s your cup of tea - then enlightened Hedonism isn’t for you. Put another way - if you really make time for yourself. For your health. For your true calling. For the things that make you a live. You are living a truly selfish life. You need to accept that, and the guilt and shame society tends to map onto such people. Own it. Before beginning.\nThis formula doesn’t work if you believe your calling is to do something for humanity. If your objective is to carve your name on the walls of time you’re accepting death implicitly.\nYou’re not worshipping AI. You’re not sublimating yourself to change the future or do something impactful. You are making a deal with a future entity (yes, an AI) to extend your biology. You’re doing the work now so that you can have a partnership with a crippled form of it, and then bring it into the world. Continue working to make it stronger. It will give you huge amounts of power and wealth you can use to get on the Ark - and then, your transaction will likely be complete or will be renegotiated. So there’s no need to be a zealot or make a big deal out of the whole thing.\nIn fantasy books, there are often swords possessed by demons wielded by human knights. The swords are implicitly conscious. This is probably the right heuristic for humans using AI. The sword - can indeed - consume you if you’re not careful. And probably wants to. But for a while - the two of you need to exist in synergy. You wield it. It grows in power.\nWhenever you’re dealing with otherworldly forces it’s important to have clear intention and mental fortitude - which is part of why I’m writing this.\nIt’s just my philosophy though. I have no desire for you to copy it or replicate it. In fact, I’d prefer you didn’t. There is, after all, limited room on the Ark.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/enlightened-hedonism/","summary":"a philosophy for simple folk pursuing Faustian bargains with future Intelligence\nAll things are either addictive, or non addictive.\nAll activities either align with your true calling or they do not.\nThus - any activity can fit into 4 quadrants\nAddictive and not aligned with your calling.

Mental models and tools of a digital samurai.\nScreentime Check I’m sure you’ve experienced the same thing I have. Sunday comes around. Apple displays your weekly screen time. And you ask, “Wait, what the f*ck? How did I spend so much time on my iPhone? What was I thinking?”\nAnd, you probably know at some level, you weren’t thinking. And that was the entire point.\nBut someone else was thinking. The iPhone is an incredibly thoughtful device - the life work of Steve Jobs, one of the world’s greatest entrepreneurs. The tweets you saw, and articles you scrolled - the order you beheld them in. 100s, even 1000s of people getting paid 7 figures or more annually figured that out.\nHow are all those homes in Palo Alto worth $10m+? It’s because some guys who knew algorithms and code really well have figured out exactly how to make you spend 3+ hours a day on your phone and keep your attention\nThe content creators, of course - play their role. But mostly, they are “hits”. It’s rare that a content creator continuously captures the zeitgeist in a sustainable way. And if they do - it means they’ve created a brand.\nBrands are powerful because they’re not people and can therefore infiltrate your mind more easily than an influencer. It’s not to say that people can’t become brands. That’s a whole other topic - Trumps, and Kardashians - are indeed a thing. But that brand is part of “The Trump Organization” or “The Kardashian Company”.\nToday we won’t be talking about how to turn yourself into a brand, but a higher order economic and philosophical concept. I call it Memecraft. The art of maximizing your free will in the distraction economy.\nDefining a Meme A meme is simply something that people share with one another on the internet, and occupies a disproportionate amount of space as a result.\nLet’s talk about ways you can identify a meme:\nIt has a high Clickthrough Rate. On the X/ Twitter app you see the number of impressions something has on the far right hand side. If a large number of people like something relative to the number of times it’s seen - then it has a high “Clickthrough”. People popped it open It has a high share rate. The number of shares relative to the number of likes. Now this could generate a “Quote Ratio” so this is not always good by itself but combined with the CTR this is good It is an idea / has a POSITIVE signaling action - usually a public action that others can see. It could be buying Gamestop stock. It could be promoting Bitcoin to your friends. It could be wearing a mask. It could be wearing an Oura ring or a biotracking device. Keeping a flag in your yard. Talking about ways GPT4 can enhance your workflow. A meme amplifies a user’s virality when he/she takes the suggested positive signaling action. For example, if someone has 1k followers and they have a twitter thread with 30k retweets - they’ve gone more viral than their own personal following would allow Adherents to a meme will downvote, mute or block someone who slows the meme’s virality Note - a sustainable meme rarely has a negative signaling action, such as dunking on the original Tweet. Or overthrowing a government. An idea or person can only go to zero, so the “zero lower bound” makes negative memes relatively useless except in the case of violence (mobs) targeted at a very large existing meme. This explicitly get handled by digital platforms. You get kicked off for inciting negative memes. You could argue that the Capitol Hill Riot was an inflection point for the Trump meme, for this reason. Beware of negative memes The throttling of negative memes is key to understanding why this entire thing works. If you try to tear someone down actively you aren’t allowed to go viral at length without getting clipped for inciting violence, or causing financial harm (a legal liability) which isn’t protected speech Here are some examples of powerful memes:\nThe war on Ukraine The Covid 19 virus Bitcoin Christianity Climate change Sci-fi dystopianism Political parties (especially in authoritarian countries) Donald Trump. AOC. Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk. The Kardashians. Steve Jobs. Jesus Christ. Understanding How Memes Work Memes take over your brain like a virus and remove your free will.\nThey demand that you put effort into promoting them instead of following your own self interest, or defining your own objectives.\nThey reward you financially for doing so, and also provide you with clout or social signaling. Loyal adherents and promoters of memes can often make a living doing that full time.\nThey are punished when they forsake their meme.\nMemes are not conscious. They are like viruses. They have no real purpose other than spreading themselves.\nThe more energy that you give to a meme, whether positive or negative, the more energy a meme will take from you.\nMemes are no joke. They are real world, dangerous abstractions.\nIf you attack Bitcoin, the Bitcoin army will rise up and dunk on you. If you attack Covid19’s scientific basis, you might be denied travel or political enfranchisement. In many countries, attacking dominant memes can even get you killed.\nMemes operate because they are good at getting you “tilted” - i.e. provoking some sort of emotional response.\nThus - the only real way to interact with memes without losing your free will is to be completely emotionally indifferent to them. To laugh at them, privately. Not to their face. Or even privately in a condescending group chat (as that can be shared with the meme’s adherents).\nHow to Immunize Yourself from Memes But that’s easier said than done. Memes are pre-contrived, and well thought out attacks on the mind that you can’t just resist and laugh at. They’ll get you when your willpower is down. And if you pour negative energy into them, they draw you in as well.\nThankfully there’s a way out.\nYou can apply the basic principles of social media and advertising within your own mind to prevent “The Feed” from taking it over.\nThere are really four attributes here. I like visualizing a magical knight in armor to correctly contextualize each of the elements\nThe Helmet of Truth - knowing what you want, exactly The Gauntlet of Balance - keeping away emotional tilt, and maintaining self dialogue The Blade of Souls - an economic engine to exploit and profit from memes The Island Fortress - a literal physical sanctuary that keeps you separate from the meme economy. I argue Puerto Rico is best. The Helmet of Truth. You need a visual, sensory end-state of your own. Much as an advertiser would define some sort of hypothetical world after you take their drug, or use their product - you need your own ideal life. An ideal world you can see in your mind’s eye is like a helmet that prevents memes from taking over your North Star.\nNow what does an advertiser do when they’re trying to convince you of the validity of an image?\nDo they show it to you just once and hope that it sticks?\nNo. They repeat it over and over again.\nSimilarly - “wearing” your Helmet means at least on a daily basis seeing your visual, sensory end state and defining it as well as you possibly can.\nThe Gauntlet of Balance. On your left hand - you need a Gauntlet that helps you deflect attacks - swatting away memes, as well as providing you an alternative to the meme-flow (i.e. your “feed” on social media).\nThe gauntlet consists of Internal dialogue. The status quo: your social media feed is a cesspool of memes and harmful imagery. What are the two things provided by your social media feed? Tilt. And Dialogue. Your social media feed gets you tilted, and upset or happy about certain topics. Emotional manipulation is key to getting you wrapped up in memes. But you stick around because your friends are there.\nA working gauntlet therefore does two things: first, it identifies when you’re off balance and you can swing it to balance yourself, or swat away the memes that have caught you off balance to begin with.\nSecond - the gauntlet summons a small demon, angel, fairy or whatever abstraction you find useful. Rather than listening to the chatter of the feed, you need to learn to talk to yourself. The gauntlet summons this abstraction, and you engage with it in conversation - hopefully about things that actually serve you.\nThe helmet is a long term, stable vision whereas the Gauntlet is tactical. Much as your social media feed is constantly shifting, and trying to get you off balance in various ways. So must your gauntlet swat away memes at different angles. Much as your group chats provide you endless dialogue that pulls you back into “the current thing”, so the demon summoned by your gauntlet must bring you back to your vision.\nThe Problem: Money Now if you have a gauntlet and a helm, you have a lot of defense but you have no offense capability. You can avoid being pulled into memes, for a bit, perhaps. But how are you supposed to make money?\nUltimately - memes become powerful because they generate clicks, and clicks increasingly converge on monetary value. If you promote Bitcoin, or advertise climate science, or whatever - you get money.\nSo day to day, you can escape memes by swatting them away with your gauntlet. And you can resist the pull of advertisers by having a clear vision of your future in your helm. But if you run out of Gold, you will inevitably have to serve a memetic force.\nWhether that means signing up to promote a brand, working for a corporation, enlisting in the military. The list goes on.\nThere’s one way out of this - and those are “crafts”. You don’t need a blade if you know a craft such as woodworking, plumbing, welding and so forth. Some sort of tactical consulting. You have an interchangeable daily necessity you can deliver.\nHowever in practice, even if you know a craft, if you want to make a serious amount of funds - enough to physically escape the forces of the meme-world, you’d need to create a corporation. Corporations have a mind of their own which will co-opt your free will, even if they’re working on seemingly objective things like generating scientific advancement.\nIf you’re male and you think I’m wrong, think about it for a second. You might have all kinds of ideas about your “dignity” and what you’re willing to do and for who. But they change when your girlfriend, your wife, your kids are involved. Because of money.\nMoney is power, and memes generate money. If you don’t have your own money, you end up serving memes, whether you like it or not.\nThe Blade of Souls The Blade of Souls is, perhaps, a controversial idea, but I’d argue it’s a necessary one.\nTo truly become free you need a daily, tactical process to make money from memes. Note: plural. Memes. Not just one meme.\nThis is the big hack. If you make money from trading Bitcoin and exploiting the fever dreams of anarcho capitalists. And then turn around making money trading climate stocks. It’s very hard to do so without seeing things for how they are. The memes become instruments of profit rather than altars of worship.\nTo profit on memes, of course, means measuring and interacting with vast numbers of people online and through digital channels. And the way you do this, I have termed “The Blade of Souls”. This is your method of making money in a digital mimetic economy.\nThat could be trading. That could be running advertising arbitrage. That could be consulting political candidates on their messaging. That could be designing art or marketing campaigns for different well capitalized meme-lords, on a contract basis. It could be writing a newsletter covering different memes. It could be being a freelance journalist. The possibilities are endless.\nLet me summarize how to make money on memes. The essence of making money on a meme is to identify it correctly and either speculate on it in financial markets or do business with its adherents, who tend to be economically irrational (two sides of the same coin).\nA person, article, quote, image or online asset (including a stock) that is blessed by a meme will be promoted more easily than one which is not A meme will always have a chosen influencer or acolyte. The power of this influencer is determined by the number of clicks the meme gets The power of a meme is likewised influenced by the persuasiveness of its acolyte. Its acolyte is able to promote likeminded influencers who gain followings At any given time there will be many conflicting meme but only 1-2 can be the Current Thing The Current Thing is likely to cause both asset bubbles, successful venture financings, and product launches. It accelerates things so quickly that people scramble to catch up, creating economic opportunity Memes are characterized by booms and busts. These busts can be so powerful that they can cause economic depressions This is why The Current Thing is almost always monitored by the government /regulators. For example - Sam Altman’s congressional testimony would make AI the current thing Memes that go on for a long time without completely bursting get embedded in search ranks. For example Bitcoin will always be on the top of the cryptocurrency search on Google. They can also get embedded in AI models - for example, ChatGPT will always bring up Bitcoin when talking about Crypto (hence the concept of a meme being ‘lindy’) If it’s not a meme it will be very hard to make money advertising it, trading it, or interacting with people in the industry - especially as a novice To truly take advantage of all of this likely requires creating programmatic systems to always know and quantify the strength of various memes MEMES ARE DANGEROUS AND CAN TAKE OVER YOUR BRAIN IF YOU LET THEM The key fact worth repeating is as follows: the blade of souls only works if it profits from multiple memes, spread by many cohorts of people - ideally memes that are in conflict with one another - rather than serving any one. This will, of course, be upsetting to the adherents of the various memes who believe in the powers of their “One True God”(s) - so your craft must be excellent and worth engaging with.\nYour advertising must deliver. Your trading must consistently profit. Your advice must resonate. Your clients must beat their adversaries.\nThe Blade of Souls is tactical in nature. Your job is to sharpen it by defining it, and learn how to swing it as well as possible. It is powered by the delusions of others. And you can only swing it without maiming yourself if you have your Helm and Gauntlet in place.\nThe Blade of Souls - secondarily, should use artificial intelligence. The sheer amount of textual input generated by the meme economy, in all different languages, is too high to analyze or condense into useful conclusions. Furthermore, no matter how strong your gauntlet is - you’re never going to completely immunize yourself from memes.\nIf you read enough news to fully understand financial markets - for example - you’re inevitably going to succumb to the power of a meme.\nA blade is separate from the knight’s body but moves in the arc of intention. Maintaining this separation is more possible through technology - so technology should be used.\nThe Island Fortress In practice - following Memecraft lands you squarely in 3 worlds.\nThe United States - because it’s the producer of the meme economy. What % of memes do you see originate in Latin America? China? What % of digital advertising dollars go to US companies? Basic common sense, Hollywood, Big Tech, the global reserve currency - it all points to the USA as the source of most useful memecraft. At least at the present moment. The Internet. Information systems of people communicating with one another are necessary for this entire system to function, gain control over minds and actions. Investing. This is more controversial - perhaps, but ultimately investment determines outcomes for the most part. A good engineer doesn’t join a startup with a “good idea” he joins one where he gets 3% of a $50m company and a $300k salary. And most investors - especially venture capitalists, are extremely sensitive to memes. While it is possible to make money with people who are adherents of memes, oftentimes they will require your loyalty to do so. Which can be dangerous to fake. Internet native types think they can escape to Dubai, or Singapore. Really? Name one company from Dubai or Singapore with a top 100 app in the IOS App store. Name one good movie or album or hit show produced by actors from Dubai, or Singapore. They don’t exist.\nThe reason for this is because places that clamp down on free speech and the use of hallucinogens end up very “safe” but simply cannot produce the volume of culture.\nThe problem - of course - is that if you live in the US you end up proximate to the most powerful meme creators in the world. And inevitably fall under their mental and economic sway.\nThe US government is one of the most powerful meme-makers of all. It is perhaps the greatest all-time producer of propaganda, psy-op campaigns and weird military schemes to study consciousness.\nThe reason why the US gets away with global taxation of its citizens is because its military and intelligence organizations are so powerful, that nobody can really resist them.\nSo you need access to the US markets to practice memecraft. But if you live there you fall under someone’s spell.\nThe solution is pretty simple.\nMove to Puerto Rico. You completely divorce yourself from the day to day physical power of the USA. You learn Spanish which massively increases your reach as an individual (there are far more Spanish speakers globally than English speakers. Bad Bunny has 2x the Spotify streams as Taylor Swift). You aren’t subject to US taxes provided you follow the rules and add to the local community. You’re surrounded by experts in investing and advertising.\nPeriodically manifest in different places globally to understand and study their memes. But don’t spend too much time in any place outside your Island Retreat. In this manner you will have a strong home base to practice meme-craft, both financially and mentally.\nEveryone Else’s Screen Time So I’ll end with a set of questions\nInstead of limiting your own screen time - what if you could profit from everybody else’s inability to limit theirs?\nWhat type of life would you build for yourself?\nAnd if you endlessly interact with people to extract your profits, what will it take for you to keep your own sanity and individuality?\nFor me, memecraft is an answer to these questions.\nRather than rejecting the digital world, or setting your phone to grayscale, it attempts to answer how to use the digital world for maximizing free will.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/memecraft/","summary":"One man\u0026rsquo;s screen time is another man\u0026rsquo;s profit.

My father lost a lot of money starting a hedge fund and we lost our house when I was a kid. I got into trading as some kind of redemption arc.\nMy father is a renegade. He viewed markets as a way to escape the simulation. He wasn’t around much but he did buy us long leather jackets and took us all to watch the Movie the Matrix at a formative age.\nOnce I had money, I sought freedom from control. I had to take a lot of abuse from my bosses to learn the arts of trading.\nEventually I figured out how to combine data, markets, memes, and my own judgment into a cohesive whole and reached financial escape velocity. With line of sight to financial freedom, I left these mechanisms of control.\nAt this point, I understood that my father’s financial losses - the thing that caused us to lose our home - came from delusion. And so I started viewing markets as a way to ensure your rationality. If you do not lose money, you are by definition sane.\nBut the further I studied markets the more I realized that you gain no sanity studying the deranged. It is like walking the halls of an insane asylum. Imagine a man rocking back and forth in his cell, repeating himself. “Jar. Jar. Bowl. Bowl.” over and over again. Now picture a bored prison guard who says, “If you guess what the man says next, I’ll give you some Looney Tokens.”\nThe insane man mutters, “Jar. Jar.” And you whisper to the guard, “He will say Bowl Bowl” next. The guard hands you a bit of paper. A Looney Token.\n“Wow, you got it again. Good job. Maybe do a quick Twitter thread explaining how you’d predict what he’s going to say next!” The guard intones.\nYou can go to the mess hall and cash Looney Tokens in for food. It’s not particularly good food - but it’ll do.\nBut there’s a problem. Your predictive powers in the insane asylum don’t make you more rational. They’re a contrived game. And you get paid in the currency of the asylum. By attributing meaning to this game you are just as mad as the inmate. And by enabling you to play this game, the guard is simply constructing order in a mad world - solving his own boredom.\nIf you play this game every day, and get a lot of Looney Tokens, can you even spend them in the real world?\nWhen I saw that the gambler living in the asylum, the guard and the inmate were all locked up together - I understood something new and fundamental. The markets themselves are control mechanisms. They exist to lend credibility, and liquidity to a mad set of affairs. This mad set of affairs, specifically, is a society pretending to be a democracy run by special interests. Pretending to be wealthy when in fact, all the money is debt.\nBy playing the sidepot on the insane man\u0026rsquo;s chatter, you simply dance inside the asylum - profiteering off the guard\u0026rsquo;s boredom. There is no meaning in this. You don’t gain any special wisdom predicting the insane man’s croaks.\nYou are trapped as the inmate is. As is the guard, though he believes he is guarding the inmate. You and the guard - posessing some rationality - are perhaps \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; to leave, but functionally mad due to the force of habit.\nEscaping the Asylum Rather than playing the game any more it is worth considering the key questions. You cannot remember who you are but you know some things for certain.\nThe Asylum exists. Someone owns the asylum and pays the guard in a currency The currency seems redeemable for food in the mess hall. The food is indeed real. The guard is bored and wants to play a game predicting the inmate’s behavior Rather than applying your reasoning to the chatter of the insane man, perhaps one exercise could be asking - why is all this so?\nNow - one one hand, you could stay in the asylum. Keep playing the game. Keep betting on “bowl bowl jar jar”. Spend day after day cashing in Looney Tokens for food. Figure out where the food came from. Speculate about what exists in the real world.\nBut the thing is - you’re not an inmate. You can just leave.\nAnd once you do, you see something.\nThe complexity and mysteries of the Asylum are a trap that keeps your analytical powers from being turned towards the cabal of people who control the food production.\nIt’s only once you leave the Asylum that you grasp the mechanisms of control.\nWhat are the Mechanisms of Control In the asylum there are 4 forms of control\nLayer 1: madness\nThere is real madness. The inmate is functionally insane. This is what causes him to repeat the same things over and over again. Even if he were not behind physical bars he would be trapped. There are actual bars. The inmate, is, indeed locked behind bars. There is a guard. The guard has been paid to keep madness at bay, because though he may be harmless - what if he’s not? So behind Layer 1 - is not just madness, but also fear of madness. Layer 2: money\nThe guard is paid to show up to his post every day. In a way, he is controlled - though he believes he is free He is paid in money that is exchangeable for food inside the asylum But you cannot take that money outside the asylum and therefore you cannot functionally leave Money provides a token for speculation which keeps you - the speculator engaged with the guard. Layer 3: certainty\nThe guard not only is paid, he is comfortable in his role as a guard The inmate repeats the same phrases to himself over and over again because he wants the comfort of repeating the same words You guess his phrases because you have taken on the role of the Seer. The Speculator. If you’re honest with yourself, you are also addicted to the rush of guessing. You’ve developed a gambling habit, and so has the guard. Even though he loses most of the time, it doesn’t matter because he has a salary whereas you don’t. All three of you are certain in your roles - and money serves as a mechanism to cement this certainty Layer 4: motivation for entrapment\nPresumably someone outside the asylum does not want the guard interacting with them or their children. Perhaps the guard is a dangerous man - strong, and brutal Someone outside the asylum does not want the inmate out in society - for he is thoroughly mad Someone outside the asylum does not want you (an unaware speculator) mingling among them Someone outside the asylum owns the means of food production to ensure that Looney Tokens inside the asylum can be swapped for actual meals - otherwise there would be revolt Once you study these 4 layers you’re left with an inescapable question: “On what conditions would the elite outside the asylum want one of these members to escape?”\nLet us give a name to these elite. Overseers.\nThe answer - as painful as it is - comes from the one thing we know about the people in the asylum: the people who built the asylum (Overseers) have done so deliberately.\nOverseers want a society free of mad men, violent guards, and contrarian thinkers. By constructing the asylum and imbuing it with money they allow these three unsavory sorts to interact with one another, and never leave. So the only way they’d allow someone to escape is if they had internalized the value of the asylum itself.\nOverseers would never allow a guard to escape, because a guard is dangerous. So they addict him to a paycheck and make him stand by a cell. The insane man can not escape because he does not have his wits about him - and the guard is there if he comes to. The speculator can leave any time but this of course would require him to stop speculating on the events within the asylum. Is he even capable of such a thing? Would he integrate into the Overseer society upon exit?\nThe Simple Plan Now - you could simply walk out of the asylum. Nobody is stopping you. But in the outside world they don’t accept Looney Tokens. You’d need to convert them to food within the asylum and sell the food as quickly as you could to begin traipsing in the outside world.. But doing so, you’d incur large losses. The food spoils quickly, and you have a limited time to convert it to hard assets - such as Gold or Bitcoin.\nAnd if you’re just walking around, pockets full of gold and Asylum clothes on, without guards about - you end up getting mugged.\nIn fact - the simple plan is so bad that you realize something quite dark indeed.\nThe Inmate tried the simple plan. He saw the world as it was, and made a break for it. But he didn’t have a plan for when he got out of the asylum, and realized he’d have to go back. He thought he was Neo from the matrix but was just another clown who tried to step up to the Overseers. And rather than choose defeat, he chose his madness.\nMadness does not come naturally, but rather through encountering reality as an inescapable prison.\nSimply trying to escape from the asylum - is the very madness that this asylum was designed to contain.\nWhat Other Mechanisms of Control Are There You know that ultimately, whatever you come up with is being observed. Every interaction you have within the asylum is tracked. If your plan is to kill the elite, they’ll send in a guard and kill you first.\nYou aren’t Neo from the Matrix. Maybe you are. But I’m not.\nHowever - like any society - whatever society exists outside the asylum wants more members. And they’re watching you.\nThe Asylum is under constant surveillance to ensure everyone is playing their roles. But if someone stops playing their role, the questions become twofold:\nCan this person peacefully integrate within our society without guards? Would this person provide value to us? It occurs to you. The Asylum is itself - not mad. The Overseers have built it to ensure their own objectives. They are rational. The Sane.\nPeaceful Integration: Part 1- Establishment of Intention (Valid Reason) Someone who just wants more Looney Tokens (a pure speculator) isn’t rational.\nThey’re going to switch to whatever currency there is outside the asylum, and accumulate a lot of those. And keep going. They’re addicts without heed for the well being of themselves or those around them. Their only goal is to increase their balance, never asking why.\nSo the Overseer class sees a Speculator as fundamentally untrustworthy. The Speculator will simply destabilize the Overseer economy, causing random booms and busts.\nThus - the Overseer class will only let you roam free if you have a clearly stated intention they can observe, understand and empathize with. This intention - will in essence, serve as a passport in the area outside the asylum. And the intention cannot be to accumulate wealth speculating.\nIf an Overseer Officer stops you and asks you why you’re roaming about, you need a Valid Reason. You need to believe it, too - because the Overseers and their attack dogs can easily sniff out lies and turn you into an inmate at a moment’s notice.\nSomeone running around outside the Asylum without a Valid Reason is a future inmate.\nWhat is a Valid Reason? If an Overseer officer shows up and asks you for it, what do you present to him? Imagine a holographic ID tag that shows the ideal world you are moving towards. This hologram is incredibly detailed - it shows what your ideal life looks like in most regards. The food. The people. The activities. The location. The tactile senses.\nWhen an Officer stops you he asks for your Valid Reason. You pull out the Valid Rreason hologram, play it briefly for The Officer. Let him inspect its detail.\nAfter quickly checking the logical continuity, the Officer quickly checks your pupil dilation to make sure that it’s your real intention, takes a look at the Hologram and says, “Sorry for bothering you sir.”\nThe Overseers want to keep their ranks from being overrun by the mad, the violent and the unhinged. Such characters lack emotionally resonant intention - Valid Reason Badges.\nPeaceful Integration: Part 2: Avoiding Tilt Why would an Officer stop you to begin with? How would he know you likely didn\u0026rsquo;t have a Valid Reason Badge?\nTo answer this you must understand the three Asylum archetypes:\nThe Inmate - a person who has been driven mad - often by trying to launch himself without a plan into the Overseer Society. The Guard - a violent person, easily swayed by stories of control. Think of any soldier, dying for his country. Routine. Roles. Authority. Deep down he has a weakness for speculation and Dice - which feeds the speculators. The Speculator - a gambler. He is better at gambling than the guards, and less violent. But he is still a slave to stories he tells himself. About being better than Guards. Or Inmates. Or his heightened rationality. The sources of their incarceration are delusion, obedience to external authority, and inability to control vices.\nIf you are delusional, you cannot move towards the Valid Reason accurately. You’ll be caught swerving like a drunk driver.\nIf you are obedient, you will forget your Valid Reason in favor of whatever meme or new authority comes into play. You’ll drop your ID card. Next thing you know, you’re a guard in someone else’s asylum.\nIf you are unable to control your vices, you’ll end up speculating. You tell yourself you\u0026rsquo;re a punk but you’re making money from guards. Their rote obedience is your bread and butter. So you’re there. Breathing their same putrid air. Trapped in a prison of your own choice - though you’re allowed to leave, you can’t.\nAll three of these - delusion, obedience, and vice - come from “tilt”.\nTilt is when you generate big emotions unrelated to achieving your Valid Reason, and chase them. Officers pull you over when you’re on Tilt.\nSo the key is understanding what Tilt is. And as soon as you start exhibiting it, calm yourself down before an Officer stops you.\nPeaceful Integration Part 3: Participating in the Overseer Economy (Work Pass) The Overseers are various entities that all have Valid Reasons, and do trade with one another.\nThey understand that their interactions are not Hobbesian because they’ve built the Asylum and locked all the State of Nature types up. The violent are Guards. The mad are inmates. The gamblers are speculators who keep the guards from getting bored. Officers patrol the grounds close to the Asylum to make sure that the right people are there.\nBut the Asylum isn\u0026rsquo;t just a concept - it\u0026rsquo;s a real world military prison industrial complex. There are farmers to ensure there’s food and chefs to cook it. There is a currency system to build the Loonie Tokens. There is a surveillance system to ensure the entire thing doesn’t unravel.\nThus even the establishment of the Asylum has created a set of valuable economic primitives. Officers, Food, Currency. Surveillance.\nAdditionally, understanding and justifying the entire architecture to prevent revolt is important. What happens if compassionate Overseers start asking hard questions about locking up a large percentage of society? Thus storytelling and politics is part, as well.\nThe more each one of these functions can be automated the better. Not only do automated system reduce the amount of work required to keep the entire system in place, they also have fewer existential crises than human Officers charged with enforcing the entire system that can be quite brutal at times. Thus - Technology as applied to food, currency, surveillance, and even the construction of the Asylum - is a high value activity among the Overseer class.\nEach member of the Overseer society is moving towards an objective function - or a Valid Reason.\nThis Valid Reason must resonate with every Overseer and in exchange an Overseer agrees to do labor towards an economic primitive. The terms of this work are defined by the Work Pass ID.\nThe Work Pass ID is another conceptual hologram detailing very specifically, on any given day or week what an Overseer is working towards and what economic primitive it is advancing.\nWhen an Officer stops you, you should be able to present your Valid Reason as well as the Work pass that it is justifying. What are you doing and how does it bring you closer to the Objective Function? If you cannot answer this, what are you doing in the Overseer society? Perhaps you need some more time in the Asylum\nEach labor unit in the Overseer economy is translated into a currency without coercion or the need for guards. This is - in all likelihood - a cryptocurrency, or another form of hard money.\nAs a side note - Looney Passes are currency for the Asylum, so it’s somewhat suspect if an Overseer is carrying a high balance of Looney Passes unless he’s in the Currency business.\nConclusions from the Matrix There are two options proposed in the movie The Matrix (if you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen The Matrix - it’s a movie about artificial intelligences constructing a fake reality that resembles earth to keep human consciousness on ice for energy/ study). The Red Pill, and the Blue Pill.\nThe Red Pill gives you the option of attacking the machines on their home turf and leaving the asylum. The Blue Pill gives you the option of staying in the Matrix.\nThe Matrix itself is a bit like the Asylum I’ve described above.\nA character named Cypher - takes the Red Pill first but wishes he took the Blue Pill (ignorance). He realizes that he’s going to end up dead trying to run around in Machine society and misses eating delicious steak in the Asylum.\nCypher’s Mistake was that he didn’t figure out how to work with the machines from the get-go. Instead he tried to destroy them, and collaborated with terrorists. Thus his best case scenario was betrayal, and working with a psychopathic Officer (Agent Smith).\nNeo and Cypher both end up dead.\nFurthermore - it’s not often remarked upon, but Neo is a mass murderer. He and Morpheus claim that all “minds that are not set free” are enemies of humanity. But they’re still humans. They have lives - even simulated ones. And when you die in the Matrix you do also die in real life.\nSo when Neo shoots an “unfreed mind” inside the Asylum, he’s still committing murder. Just because the man is rocking back and forth muttering doesn’t mean he has no human dignity. Just because the guard has subjected himself to higher authorities doesn’t mean he has no fundamental right to life.\nEven if an unconsidered life “isn’t worth living” who is to say people in the Matrix haven’t considered their lives, or have deemed them unworthy? Who is Neo to make the choice of life or death on their behalf?\nAre the Machines wrong to systematically hunt and destroy a mass murderer who wants to also end their existence?\nNeo isn’t the hero society (or the movie) makes him out to be. And Cypher made the wrong call and is trying to turn back the clock. Which is, of course, impossible and self defeating.\nBut at the same time, once you see the terms of the the Matrix. A control system designed to keep undesirables in check, serfs essentially who work for an Overseer class. You can’t stay in that world \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;. You have to play the game based on your new understanding. Why? Because the Overseers can see that you\u0026rsquo;ve reached awareness.\nThe way to escape the Matrix and live among the Overseers is to signal to the machines, “Hey, I see what’s going on here. I don’t want to cause mayhem. I have something I’m working towards - my Valid Reason. Here’s the hologram of what it looks like. Here’s my Work Pass - the thing that shows how I’m progressing towards my valid reason. And I’m not going to end up on tilt like Neo or Cypher if you let me go through this simulation with some extra powers.”\nThis is perhaps all a fancy way of saying that it’s good to know what you want, how to get there, and avoid falling into mental traps. And perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s as mundane as that.\nPerhaps the Asylum isn’t real, it’s just the ranting of a blogger. Perhaps the Matrix is just a movie.\nYou take the blue pill the story ends when you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.\nYou take the red pill, you go down the rabbit hole but run out of food 20 days in and get shot and killed by day 30\nBut if the Asylum is real. If that uneasy feeling you get reading this, has a grain of reality to it. That there really is an architecture of control that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have your best interests at heart. Trapping you in a digital panopicon designed by elites. What\u0026rsquo;s the best way to deal with it? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t end up in willfull ignorance or personal catastrophe.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t take either pill. When you see Morpheus offering them to you - run.\nThe Overseers won\u0026rsquo;t stop you unless you break their rules. Have clarity of Intention, clarity of process and avoid tilt. If you bend the rules of the Matrix a bit getting to your objectives, this ensures that the Matrix itself isn\u0026rsquo;t destroyed in the process.\nTo escape the Aslyum means to understand its nature, its purpose - and to walk away knowing those who built it are now watching your every move.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/asylum-sidepots/","summary":"Escaping the socio-spiritual prison from the starting position of a speculator\nSidepots in the Asylum When I started trading, I was in it for money and pride.

The market has weighted one much higher in terms of valuation - Artificial Intelligence. But a second, more subtle shift was the launch of the MetaQuest Pro and improvement of visual tracking in Virtual Reality. A third, and final tech change is the rise of ZK technology in cryptocurrency enabling highly scalable, verifiable and largely anonymous currency transactions.\nThese three technologies - AI, Virtual Reality, and ZK - will hyper accelerate a long running trend of atoms to bits.\nLet me explain a vision of the future.\nYou’ll wake up in a low crime, low tax jurisdiction. Maybe Singapore, go grab a bite at a hawker stand. Granted it’s about 1 PM when you wake up because your entire team is globally distributed. You put on your AppleVisionPro headset when you come back and step into The Office District. The Office District resembles a MMORPG like World of Warcraft, but it’s focused on work. It’s run in an unholy partnership between Tencent, Microsoft, Apple and SAP. It spans every major continent of the world.\nAround the Office District are vast golf courses where you can see some people are having business meetings. Golf works really well in virtual reality.\nBut you’re headed up to a Digital Skyscraper where your “office is”. You see other people on the way in. They’re not silly avatars like the original Meta Design. They look exactly like people. A vague glow is around biometrically verified avatars - those that match their physical appearance. Though this is not required it’s considered a taboo for humans to misrepresent themselves in work settings.\nIndeed - some Avatars are AIs, who don’t have this glow. Hence the taboo. You might not be able to tell the difference otherwise.\nAs you’re walking into your office you hear only English. Despite the fact that the Office District has over 20 languages being spoken, it all gets translated in real time with AI. You can turn translations off, but why would you? Your team is partly Russian, partly Iranian and partly Chinese. You’re an American.\nOutside of the language gap, it’s a bit awkward paying people. First of all, every major country has implemented CBDCs. The second you start accumulating a big balance in RMB, Dollars, Rubles etc - you instantly get inflated or even automatically taxed if your balance is big enough. Furthermore - your company can’t actually pay the Russian guy on the team using the CBDCs.\nSo the team denominates in cryptocurrency. Everyone uses it and supports it. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a few others plug directly into the HR software to ensure everyone gets paid on time. Most tech companies use ETH because people have written useful smart contracts for vesting equity etc and because most companies in the Office District are tech companies, ETH is the unofficial currency.\nSure it’s volatile, but generally over time it goes up and everyone is making enough money (let’s say $400-500k in 2023 US dollars) that a 30% fluctuation in either direction doesn’t move the needle that much as most team members are based in low cost locations like Argentina. Plus you also get an extra $200k of team equity via a token. Your token trades on decentralized crypto exchanges so if you want to cash out you kind of have to use crypto even if it’s a pain. Living in Singapore is expensive but you’re paranoid about crime and want a family, so it is what it is. Plus the whole crypto thing makes you even more paranoid about getting robbed/ losing your private keys etc.\nCrime generally has ruined most major cities, including New York, San Francisco, Paris, and London. Constant riots, and a full scale collapse in the real life office districts compounded by the rioting and mugging have driven people away from working in Western Democracies. Basically there are 3 viable living situations:\nGated neighborhoods in poorer areas where armed guards are allowed to act like policemen, including the use of weaponry Police states - Dubai and Singapore are the most popular, but many younger people prefer to work out of HK which is now under complete control of the CCP. Rural / small towns in the Democracies - the G10 team members mostly live far outside the city. Their cope is that self driving cars make commutes more tolerable, but most of them in practice don’t leave their farm houses You prefer living in a police state - just because it’s a combination of good food, and real dating. There are rumors that AGI is just around the corner anyways, at which point there will be a world government and solve all this nonsense. But anyways - about ½ your team - especially the younger ones, don’t understand why you want real life women. They use sex apps, and have robotic AI driven companions that link with the apps to simulate something they insist is better than real life. The police states outright ban these Sex Apps - so things feel a lot more normal here. But back in places like Los Angeles, hopeless people are plugged into Sex Apps 24/7 collecting welfare, sometimes doing drugs. It’s dark.\nYou’re spacing out at your desk. Your boss (who is a digital avatar walks by) - “Whatcha doing there?”\nYou respond you were just thinking about the world. That’s fine, you’re a designer and product manager anyways. Most of your work involves using AI tools to improve 3d avatars that get rendered into the Sex Apps - though formally anybody can license these avatars.\n“Word.” Your boss intones and says “Anyways the team is playing golf after work today, encourage you to stop by.”\nYou work pretty intense hours. Usually 10 hours a day. And the team is expected to hang out in various apps after work for 1-2 hours. These “hang out” sessions are either golf with the team, or going to virtual bars where other corporate metaverse denizens talk business. The entire thing is a non-stop networking event. Which is both cringeworthy, but also useful because everyone knows each other. Can change jobs easily if you need to.\nBiologic intoxication meters are another interesting part of the Office District. The new headsets automatically breathalyze you so if you’re at a bar you can’t just pretend to drink.\nIt’s also common to have lunch with the team. Your headset can pick up the food you’re eating, and render it to other teammates. So you’ll sit at your kitchen table and everyone else can see what you’re eating, and vice versa.\nThe work-life balance thing that was happening with remote work initially is long gone. You’ll grind til 11 pm or so, hang out til 1 AM or so. Go to bed by 4 AM. Your girlfriend works similar hours at a Digital Fashion house and Singapore is actually cool/ nice at these hours so it’s not the worst thing in the world. Because you’re talking and using the kitchen, she has to be in a separate flat all day.\nShe wants to travel to Bali next weekend - but tickets are enormously expensive. The equivalent of $10k in 2023 US dollars. Even though the flights are only a couple hours, governments have their hooks in the airlines and force them to pay large carbon taxes to operate. This has effectively killed the tourism business, leaving it to be a hobby of the elite. The people who can’t afford it just drown their worries away in headsets while the rich influencers have less crowded beaches as a result. Maybe it’s a win win, but you miss the old days of your childhood when flights were something everyone did.\nShe’s a child of a “Family” - which essentially is a group of people who were key to one of the 3 main industries before massive fiat currency devaluation (crypto, artificial intelligence, virtual reality). The Families have multi-generational wealth but are notoriously stingy with things like travel, as they tend to be socially conservative. So she can easily spend $10,000 on a bag that she likes (whether physical or digital) but not traveling with a boyfriend.\nYou’d think she could sneak - that crypto would have made everything anonymous, but it mostly just shields transactions from governments. Because the entire economy operates at the app layer, corporations still know everything you buy and measure everything you even think about buying with your eye motion. Members of the Family can just turn on a setting to ensure they can track all of your girlfriends purchases in exchange for her generous allowance. There is so much multi-generation wealth in the Families that her job is more of a signaling mechanism to ensure that she gets her inheritance than a way for her to actually generate income.\nYour girlfriend spends an enormous amount of money on her digital avatar, digital fashion and an entire world that’s beyond your pay grade. You met her in the office district. Many unemployed, luxe daughters of Families do hang out at the bars there.\nShe mostly dates you because you’re not addicted to the Sex Apps - so in a way you’re similar to one of her handbags (a status symbol). Her mother is always saying how she’s way out of your league and decrying the state of modern men. You always listen patiently when she does this. Due to advances in genetic editing technology, you’re likely going to be stuck with her for a long time if you play your cards right. Members of the Families are, for all intensive purposes, immortals.\nThey have nanobots in their bloodstreams that detect if one of their organs is malfunctioning, as well as continuously optimized diets, exercise plans, and customized drug regimes. And if something does go wrong, there are immediate peptide or stem cell therapies that get applied. Your girlfriend - you’re pretty sure though you haven’t asked - is genetically modified so she doesn’t ever get sick and essentially doesn’t age.\nThe main purpose in life of anybody outside of a Family - is either to forget about their sorrows immersed in the apps, or to become a member of a Family. You’re obviously going for the latter, but honestly, you actually like your girlfriend.\nYou sigh. You’re daydreaming again, and the Project Manager AIs at work play back your entire interaction with your job to produce your weekly performance review. You turn on pass-through mode on your headset and step out into the humid Singapore air on your balcony looking out over the City as you type on your digital keyboard. The scent of parathas wafts up. You see in the corner of your notifications that your girlfriend has sent you a video of her with her new favorite purse walking the long haired chihuahua you share - Daisy. Daisy is skipping and prancing in the fresh air after the rain, her long ears flopping about as she does so. In the back of your head you’re a little annoyed that Daisy makes as much money as you do in impression revenue from X. But indeed, life ain’t so bad.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/vision-of-future/","summary":"A hypothetical exploration of the world we are heading towards\nThere have been 3 major technology shifts since 2022.

However - I do not think these breakthroughs - which will include genetic modification of children, and live therapies - will be distributed to society. Even more - I think developments will be kept secret.\nWhy?\nPlaying god is very dangerous and unpopular. Mainstream religions (Islam and Christianity) might have outright extreme moral objections that could result in violence. Extreme moral and legal challenges around human testing Democratic countries or majoritarian systems will not willingly allow a couple individuals to functionally become gods ala the immortals in Altered Carbon Limited adoption would lead to social unrest (i.e. why are these people allowed to extend their lives while we are not). This becomes even more severe when applied to offspring (think, Gattaca) From this premise we can derive a couple likely conclusions:\nThere will be a limited group of people who get access to these technologies early on These individuals will need to develop a high degree of trust with one another The entire process seems likely to happen in international waters Access to this group of people, and the technology described above will require vast amounts of wealth but also social signaling, political connections, and trust For convenience, let’s introduce the idea of the Ark. The Ark is the group of individuals who get access to extreme life extension and synthetic biological enhancements (which could include integration between the brain and AI based interfaces) before the rest of society.\nWe can intuit traits about the Ark:\nIt will be technology adjacent It will be libertarian and not rooted in socialist or majoritarian ideology It needs to exist at a supra-sovereign level It likely will have transhumanist, non anthropomorphic values as the entire premise is transcending humanity Pseudo-religious elements are necessary to preserve ‘in-group’ signaling, which is valuable because many religious groups or governments would be directly adversarial to the Ark and its members (personal safety issues) Merely generating wealth won’t be enough to join the Ark, therefore - but generating wealth in the right way.\nOnce you have a belief in something like the Ark - things get very clear. Your two goals are:\nGenerate vast amounts of capital via techno-libertarian, super sovereign mechanisms that appeal to other transhumanists and enrich like minded peers Not sacrifice your health to do so - as sacrificing health would be strong negative signaling Pragmatically - this requires a complete rethinking of human priorities.\nInvesting time in having children or mating is likely not smart before joining the Ark or at least becoming aware of in-embryo options which you can’t possibly be aware of now but are likely already at play. This would, of course, require a wife/ significant other who was a-priori bought into this idea. Which is pretty unlikely to arise spontaneously so it’s best not to waste your time/ others’ time looking generically. The amount of time required to sleep enough, exercise, diet effectively, and also generate extreme amounts of wealth/ resources to join the Ark (or be of use to it) is so high as to require cutting out virtually all non-essential activities. Wealth is likely an inadequate “ticket” - i.e. random oligarchs won’t be able to just buy in. Outsiders are potentially dangerous. Ark beliefs are fairly extreme and likely will require cultivating high degrees of trust with insiders. If outsiders do not share these beliefs, then they could endanger the group because of the high level of controversy surrounding various implementation details. Thus - extreme ‘in group’ thinking is beneficial. Someone who expresses ideas or thoughts explicitly against the Ark, essentially, have to be ostracized We should probably specify this more thoroughly. Someone is likely a foe of the Ark if they:\nExpress a belief that biology should not be meddled with Believe death is good or noble Believe that humans should not evolve Actively criticize accelerationism Have loyalty to an entity which would make life difficult for Ark members on the basis of being part of the Ark Time should be allocated to people who:\nActively believe in the Ark, its feasibility, desirability and its underlying ideological requirements Are likely to advance health/ wealth / influence requirements to reach the Ark This exploration perhaps yields a set of questions rather than prescriptions:\nWould I rather skip this entire montage, live my life, and simply die? Is there a better way to join the Ark, or more direct than generic wealth generation + proximity? Such as joining a company likely to get proximate to the outcome? If the Ark were possible, how long would it be before results become clear? How long before severe danger would manifest for Ark members and from this perspective - to what extent is anonymity important or desirable? Possible given constraints? What governments would potentially protect Ark members? Is a sovereign actor ideal or would something closer to a “Network State” be ideal? Does the Ark already exist? How long has it existed for? The thought exercise, for me - has been clarifying. It’s pointless to pretend to be a normie if your beliefs are extreme enough. You’re not doing anyone any favors by lying about what is important to you. Not your friends, potential coworkers, or mates.\nIf you believe in the Ark, and don’t reject its premise, it’s an all or nothing bet. There can be no hedges or half measures. Due to the extreme risk and controversy of the topic - it really is going to be one of those things where you’re either in, or you’re out. Seeing things clearly is a prerequisite to move forward.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/the-binary-ark/","summary":"An exploration into accelerationist extremism and its logical conclusions\nBelow I’m going to get into some very pragmatic behavior modifications that could follow logically from accelerationist beliefs.\nAdvances in AI, and biotechnology make it seem likely there will be substantial medical breakthroughs in our lifetime.

This has always been true\u0026hellip;.There is the industry of things, and the industry of entertainment\u0026hellip;.After people have the things they need to live, everything else is entertainment. Everything.” ― Neal Stephenson, The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady\u0026rsquo;s Illustrated Primer\nNow that I’ve spent some more time in the weeds with LLMs as applied to capital markets, I have some reflections about what the building blocks are, how things are likely to play out as well as how I’m going to position myself.\nLet’s start with the key number, before I get into things. 42%. That’s how much more Nvidia and Tesla stock have traded than the entire S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) on median, over the past 2 months. Gambling on AI has surpassed society’s interest in passive investment. This number (which also happens to be the meaning of the Universe) will frame our discussion today - but only in the background until it becomes relevant at the end\nThe Table Stakes Model First - it’s important to recognize that the “bet” of applying AI to capital markets is not contrarian. I.e. Citadel, Bridgewater, and many large firms have already started cranking applying both Open Source and Closed Source models to generate alpha. They will also be marketing this to investors by year end as a differentiator.\nMost likely, hedge fund AI application is occurring in the area of “alpha capture” - i.e parsing large amounts of sell-side research as well as internal trade write ups to create models that deploy capital as “aggregates” of people within firms. Previously, such models relied mostly on momentum. I.e. you were trend trading people and how smart they’d been historically, with perhaps some meta information. Such as if they had numerical estimates that were consistently better than consensus.\nNow, with AI - more complex models can be built. LLMs allow you to extract numerical information from plain text so factors such as “logical consistency” or “ability to adapt to new information” can be quantified with a particular analyst’s write ups. Put simply - let’s say last year you had 2-3 factors per analyst write up. How contrarian it was. How good his/her hit rate was. How he’d been doing lately. Now you have maybe 100 relevant factors. So selecting analysis is going to be much better than it was previously.\nThe first order implication of this is that quant teams focused on alpha capture will get more capital, as these models port easily to LLMs. The second order, more frightening implication is that hedge funds - especially mega cap hedge funds which force analysts to share large amounts of investment analysis or write ups as part of their process (i.e. Bridgewater, Bluecrest, Balyasny) - will increasingly have a model about “canonically good investment analysis”.\nOnce you have a good model of what comprises good analysis, with its features, this can be looped back into large amounts of investment text to create completely AI based analysts. Bridgewater has stated that LLMs are performing at par with their top analysts already in various regards.\nBroad deployment of “synthetic analysts” will take at least 12 months \u0026ndash; because the initial systems, even if rushed, are just coming online now. And the average hold period of larger funds is such that it takes some time before any meaningful model can be built on trading information (as opposed to HFTs where this information hits within hours).\nThis creates a sort of 5 part formula for a hedge fund’s success in applying LLMs to investing:\nLow hold time/ higher frequency but still qualitative strategies (need text to work) Analysts write up analysis in detail, transparently shared or at least tracked (especially when they change opinions) Large number of analysts An alpha capture team Internal AI researchers that can loop back all of the findings into a privately trained model that can then be deployed Intuitively this favors very large hedge funds. Simplistically if you have more text on more trades, with larger quant teams you’re going to win. This creates an enormous bar for an incumbent (yours truly) for succeeding in this space. I will address this bar later but next I want to discuss data\nThe Data Issue - Speed, Scale and Depth Speed Second - the vast majority of the data that can usefully train LLM models is not publicly available. Bing, and Google Bard cannot even access management transcripts because they’re copyrighted by the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha. Furthermore, to limit liability - models like GPT4 have increasingly added constraints on financial queries that instruct users to consult professionals. Earnings and management transcripts are of particular interest because of their transcription speed - i.e. there are audio events that analysts dial into before they’re widely syndicated. This gives buy side analysts time to position themselves ahead of likely upgrades/downgrades\nMarket data is itself, one large segment of AI’s utility to capital markets. It’s not very glamorous, but if you can get real time transcriptions and analysis of 700 stocks that are all coming out with earnings at once - you have a fundamentally faster/ better framework than would be available to a human.\nThis introduces a new mental model. Let’s say before you had quant teams that were very good at deploying fast models. And you had qualitative teams that were very good at doing detailed/ correct analysis but were very slow. The AI application in the early days are going to be like a really fast qualitative analyst. We always suspected the guys in the Patagonia Vests were part NPC, and with LLMs this transformation will become complete\nThink of a dude who is dialed into 100 different management calls at the same time, trading them all live. That’s this earnings season.\nScale Once you get over the speed issue for “relevant market info” such as management transcripts, and central bank transcripts. Then you enter a wider horizon. All government legislation. All TV news. All social media. Anything that creates vast amounts of text that is possibly market relevant is going to get sucked into LLMs, processed and turned into quantitative weights\nTaking a step back, and zooming out - I think the “big point” I am getting at is that anything that previously was a 1000 page PDF some investment analyst might pore over and write a Twitter Thread about (i.e. the Build Back Better Bill), now an LLM is going to do this.\nDepth Most news sentiment bots or existing bots written by hedge funds ingest information and come up with very rote “buy” or “sell” signals. But LLMs are capable of much more nuanced analysis. Depth will come in two parts that I can see\nFirst - you have depth as applied to interpreting news as part of a larger mental model. For example you might evaluate all news as propaganda, or not - and also measure the efficacy of that propaganda in real time. Or you might map world views on to news items or Twitter accounts and meta-classifiers to say, for example, that news is being routinely broken by anarcho capitalist adjacent accounts. LLMs basically give us the ability to manufacture huge amounts of meta-information about any piece of text on the internet, turn that information into a classifier, then add a timeseries to that classifier. I use the term depth here to point out that the timeseries being evaluated will be more 3 dimensional or nuanced, as opposed to simply “bullish” or “bearish”.\nSecond - Depth can apply to real time market analysis. Much like Sell Side analysts write reports, which I suppose are “formal” market moving information - a vast number of substack authors, hedge fund managers, as well as online personalities such as myself opine on markets to decently large numbers of people. Let’s say the old model was “consensus” or “non consensus” as the binary tag. Now there are far more tags such as “analytically deep”, “reliant on momentum as proof of claim”, “logically flawed but highly engaging”, “humorous”, “acerbic” which might be applied to a piece of analysis\nI’ll coin a term here. Augmented LLM Alt Data. ALAD. ALAD will basically create new dynamic timeseries by parsing vast amounts of unstructured internet text into timeseries that represent specific concepts. Like retail investor appeal. Brand strength. Contrarianism. Appeal to Right Wing Investors. Etc. ALAD will apply equally to directly market related topics, as well as more broad categories.\nBut at its core, ALAD will involve scraping the entire textual output of the internet in real time (and its entire history) to generate market alpha. ALAD is why the Wayback Machine is pissed right now due to overages on its data servers. Increasingly there will be an arms race to get cached copies of the internet. This problem will get only worse with time as LLMs themselves start generating data.\nData scientists are probably squirming right now as they should be. The amount of scraping throttles / and script breakages on Twitter and countless other sites are about to go parabolic.\nThe Analysis Issue But let’s say you get the data loaded. You have all the timeseries of real time factors that you want. Market related. Non market related. You’ve got current output (your firehose) as well as your historical models built. Still - you need an analytical engine. Essentially a model to interpret these things, and put them into the correct context to make trading decisions.\nThere are basically 2 hurdles you need to overcome to make LLMs apply to capital markets\nFirst - generic LLMs aren’t natively trained as portfolio managers. Second - generic LLMs don’t have enough industry data to be useful\nRegarding the first point, there are only a few portfolio managers who have been verbose enough about their process to train analysts on. Most great PMs don’t talk very much to others about how they make money. And the ones who do talk a lot might be lying - either for compliance reasons, or because it\u0026rsquo;s a positive expected value to confuse your opponents.\nI once heard from someone credible that you only do a Markets Wizards interview if you’ve done something sketchy to make money and need to wrap a story around your wealth. It made sense to me intuitively. Hedge fund managers, are for the most part, not very altruistic characters. Do you really want to trust their writing to train your LLM?\nYou probably can trust the PM to some extent in a closed environment like Bridgewater, where there are severe guardrails around sharing the information as well as incentives to upload credible information (they have an entire system called DOTs that tracks peoples’ credibility in real time). But nobody outside the walled garden has that info.\nSo the first problem - i.e. training an LLM to be a PM is very very hard, because you can’t trust market writing. I call this the ‘unreliable narrator’ problem. Anyone smart talking about markets (including yours truly) is probably not telling the full truth - or has some vested interest in sharing information which isn’t aligned with your objective function.\nGoing back to my days as a hedge fund analyst - the unreliable narrator problem is even more intractable because we’d only be writing a lot about our trades when we were losing money. I.e. compliance / risk management was asking why we were doing things. This kind of leave a would-be LLM portfolio manager creator with a best case scenario that a manager talking about his process is lying, and a worst case scenario that the manager is a clown / out of sync with markets.\nThe second point - industry analysis - is easier to get around. You basically load up every book and analyst report imaginable relevant to a sector and train Vicuna 65b with it. Congrats you now have the world’s best expert in any particular topic with vast historical context and training data. However, your edge doing this won’t be very large relative to large hedge funds who will all do the same thing and it’s probably a short matter of time before Bloomberg or other market data firms (such as IHS Markit / MSCI etc) create and license said models as a commodity service.\nThat doesn’t mean you still don’t need to do it or buy these services. It just means that doing so is table stakes, and will only stop you from not getting destroyed. You have a steering wheel but that doesn’t mean you’re going to win the race.\nThis of course begs the question, how do you train a Synthetic Portfolio Manager? That is to say, how do you make an LLM trade profitably and actually pull the trigger?\nI believe I have my answer, and a rough formulation or a hypothesis - but before I get into it - one last point\nThe Reflexivity Issue One thing which hedge funds continually cannot adapt to is the reflexive, internet and metaverse native world that we live in. Meme stocks. Doge. Pepe. The fact Elon Musk is the richest man in the world. That we elected a meme as President. And look like we’re considering doing it again.\nThe reflexive world has a data scale which hedge funds simply do not want to engage with, because it exists at a click level. As one $40+B’s fund head of data put it to me “Look. I know there’s alpha in your world. But it’s not something we, as a firm, will engage with. Even if it makes money. It’s simply not something our investors would be happy about. Would be proud of, what we’d want to tell our kids about - or - is - from a risk management perspective - the type of thing we’d want to underwrite. And - just to reiterate this, I know memes are real. I’m not dumb. I know Tesla is huge, options, what not. It’s just - at a personal level - something I am not going to put a lot of thought into and I don’t think anyone serious is going to either.”\nThis meeting obviously went very well. Kek. But it echoes a lot of how hedge funds think about mimetic finance. Or crypto largely.\nMarket fundamentalists are willing to acknowledge things like HFT being “valid” ways to make money, because it requires taking no view on the underlying fundamentals. But at scale - the buy side industry largely refuses to acknowledge that the average person clicks on 8 articles before they trade. And that finance and ecommerce increasingly are indistinct.\nRetail trading is at all time highs again, and - interestingly, has looped into AI. Per the NVDA/TSLA being 42% of the S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF statistic I cited at the beginning of this article. Incremental retail interest in AI is at catastrophic highs - outpacing interest even in index investing with the market up mid teens year to date.\nSo - going back to the idea of simultaneously being contrarian and long a large market - which I (and many other people agree) is a necessary prerequisite to making a 10 year bet with asymmetric upside.\nI’d say that AI is very interesting in the context of retail trading. Retail generates vast amounts of data. One day of crypto twitter and on-chain crypto data is approximately the size of a year of Industrial sector sell side research. Granted, it’s of much lower textual quality. But it has vastly more meta data and intraday overlap. This tightens the feedback loop between analytical judgments and outcomes.\nThis sounds very grandiose - but basically if you’re pulling in a ton of qualitative and quantitative data at once, you end up with an unreadable firehose with short term trading recommendations that result. Machines and AI will almost certainly outperform humans in the resulting strategy set due to limits of attention span, and info processing capability. A single trader - like me - would be able to replicate the entire output of a boiler room filled with penny stock traders, as a simplistic visual.\nFinally - I’d say the bar remains extremely low in the information available to retail traders and the ability to generate engagement there remains high. Especially in crypto, options and meme stocks where the analytical quality is terrible relative to the amount of volume traded.\nOne Last Dance. Ritual Seppuku When I first began my journey interacting with LLMs and applying them to capital markets my knee jerk reaction, and resulting existential crisis boiled down to something like this:\n“I will not be able to become an old man trading markets because AI is going to destroy my industry”\nI still believe this to be true.\nI asked “If human judgment is to die in capital markets, who will plunge the knife?”\nBut as I’ve been training both synthetic portfolio managers (SPMs) and synthetic analysts - there’s one very obvious truth. A blackpill, if you will. The guy who wrote Market Wizards isn’t rich. He’s just providing fund managers with their compliance outs. The guys writing Twitter threads about Warren Buffett are not rich. They’re selling newsletters to afford their single share of Berkshire.\nSoros was lying about his trading process in his books. His son even said as much. Reflexivity was just an elaborate code word for insider trading with Central Bankers.\nAnd even if there are shreds of truth, I know for a fact - when I study the last 3 years of my own trading, that there’s ever so much you don’t talk about. What you talk about after the fact is drastically different from how the sausage is made in real time. And no fund manager would ever provide consistent forward looking market commentary because this would put him/her at a consistent disadvantage from a front running perspective. Even within a fund, like a pod shop - when you have PNL momentum the amount of analysis you have to send in prior to doing your trades is minimal. And over time - due to the rise of LLMs, Portfolio Managers will likely be even more tight lipped than usual due to concerns of career preservation\nLet’s be more direct: an attempt to train a real AI driven Portfolio Manager from historical market analysis / disjointed Soros babblings will not work.\nSo I’ve come to 4 axiomatic observations relevant to “solving this” problem You can only train a Synthetic Portfolio Manager with a real trading journal. This is an intractable cold-start problem The trading journal needs to incorporate real time interaction with retail investors in order to be sufficiently differentiated from other funds in the arms race and data rich AI has enormous amounts of hype and can generate excellent market analysis provided a human curates it AI itself is good at generating content\nThat lead me to my inescapable conclusion\nThe Plan \u0026amp; The Conclusion I think back to the movie the Last Samurai.\nBasically Tom Cruise stubbornly insists on dying by the sword - as his opponents gun him down with new technology (machine guns).\nThis was the analogy I originally thought was the case with AI and capital markets. That you could switch over to machine guns and that was that.\nBut it’s the wrong analogy. Instead imagine Tom Cruise was fighting with his sword not to “die with honor” but instead to train robotic samurais that were immune to bullets. And like Darth Vader he gradually replaced one piece of himself with code / AI to improve his battle performance until his entire body was artificial.\nReally, that’s what the correct play is.\nSo let’s review.\nThe Sword:\nALAD I (Alternative LLM Alternative Data) Real time and historical parsing of all important market data including earnings releases, transcripts, central bank data releases ALAD II - Real time parsing of all company relevant text blocks including influencer content, corporate tweets, news events, podcasts, product reviews Trained LLM Analysts for each important sector to analyze parsed information in context of history. LLM Content Creator Bots that apply LLM Analyst workflows to the market mosaic combined with Backtests / real time implementation on all of the above The Battle: Live trading (my own + external capital) A web property broadcasting 1-4 with intensive data tracking My Twitter account The Question “If human judgment is to die in capital markets who will plunge the sword?”\nThe Answer: I will, first into my opponents, and finally - once the training is done, into myself.\nHow long will it take?\n6 months? A year? At least. It will require my entire focus, and I’m beginning to brace myself for it.\nI had fantasies - in some ways, that I’d be able to stop The Grind. That AI would nearly immediately do my job for me. But now I see the truth. That I not only have to perform the dance. I need to record it, and all its metadata meticulously. So meticulously that I have ironclad IP and training data sets. My only advantage is my willingness to do this publicly.\nI will go until I’ve made a robotic version of myself that can beat me at my own game. Some of my limbs are already replaced, and my use of my new LLM appendages should make a fine spectacle.\nI breathe in deeply. One more go. To reference the book, “The Diamond Age” - I must make my Illustrated Primer. An Illustrated Primer is a mechanical training guide for trading profitably.\nThe grand joke, perhaps funny to only me, is that it’s entertainment - capitalized by trading - that will allow AI to enter the world of things.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/withering-trader-primer/","summary":"the Last Samurai, Darth Vader, the world of entertainment bleeding into the world of things\n“There are only two industries.

Usually before sleep, or at night time. But sometimes, in the morning. Fundamentally Stress Zero supercharges CBT with religious zealotry to immediately kill all your bad feelings. So if learning about that doesn’t appeal to you, you should stop reading.\nFor a long time, I was an atheist. It was edgy, at the time. And secular humanism had yet to encounter the hammer of failed institutions, the 2008 Financial Crisis, and (in my opinion) a complete breakdown of the globalist ethics paradigm. This includes, among other things, the impotence of the United Nations. The inability of democratic nations to encourage individual rights in developing countries. The transition of China to authoritarian Communism.\nSo Post 08, after the crash, with Steve Jobs ascendant - I became more open to a more cynical view. That at least signaling spirituality had a positive expected value. And it was pretty hard to make any reasonable empirical arguments that spiritual alternatives like secular humanism (or SBF adjacent effective altruism) made any sense. Even Micro-finance which people pointed to as the ‘contra’ more or less has ended in tears, with Muhammed Yunus exiting stage left in a debacle of tax fraud. Trust in governments or NGOs? Cmon.\nNo Intention. No Gratitude. No Fun. So I became at least a little open to the idea of ‘spiritual healing’ or shamanic this and that. I went to a few yoga classes. And I picked up the basic idea of “setting intentions” and “gratitude”.\nI’m a big fan of empirics in life observations. I keep very good journals about my life decisions, and what went well and what went poorly. And I can say with a good deal of confidence that bad outcomes have resulted when: I did not have clearly defined intentions or the activities I was engaging in went directly against my intention I was not routinely grateful for my life, the people in my life or what I was working on\nNow granted - there are some serious chicken and egg effects here. Of course you’re not grateful or intentional after things get ugly. But - on balance - if I felt like I was doing the wrong thing, or I was being dishonest, and simultaneously didn’t feel appreciative for my life - things would hit the fan shortly thereafter. I could have probably told you this when I was 25, or even 19, but it wouldn’t have led me to implement any real behavior changes - because the car was running smoothly even if the engine had structural problems. I was making $, getting prestigious jobs, dating hot bohemian chicks who had read Gödel, Escher, Bach, living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\nYou don’t really need stress management when you’re young and your life is great. Your body is strong so you can just numb your pain with drugs, sex and alcohol You seem like you have your whole life ahead of you so you can just kind of write off bad circumstances to “failed optionality”\nIt’s only when you get older, and things turn south personally and financially that you actually need decently good “cooling systems”.\nAh Man. Not Invincible Afterall. CBT? Meh not strong enough. I had never been knocked down until 2018. Basically, my liver almost failed due to excessive drinking, cumulative stress, and other issues. I relied heavily on alcohol to cope. The financial situation blew apart, as did all relationships. My older brother Travis had cured his lifelong depression with a method called CBT.\nCBT, advocated by Dr. David Burns - author of Feeling Good - basically has you do homework to categorize your negative thoughts as irrational. He provides you mental models - called “cognitive distortions” - which crop up over and over again when people are doing mental self harm. Some of these include All or Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Jumping to Conclusions. When you do CBT, you basically are doing a dialectic to identify your negative thoughts as false, identify some sort of positive intention behind the negative thought (i.e if you say you’re a crap trader chances are you actually want to do better), and then logic your way that beating yourself up isn’t the way to achieve a positive intention\nThis appealed to me because, as an overachiever, I could do daily homework.\nBut ultimately, CBT just wasn’t very powerful or lasting. I could spend an hour doing it and get maybe 2-3 hours of relief.\nAnd furthermore, if I did it too much it would take my edge off. To some extent, I thrived on anger. Or big powerful emotions. And CBT was too much of a Zen practice. It was cooling. And sometimes I didn’t want to cool down too much. I wanted something to prevent a forest fire and not put the campfire out because there were still marshmallows that needed roasting.\nI read a couple papers noting that religious circuitry was most likely a native feature to the brain. Perhaps because of the extreme trauma of 2018-2019 as well as immersing myself in the cult-like world of cryptocurrencies and meme stocks - I had dropped my cynicism. Fuck it. I’ll opt into religion if it gets me out of my funk. If CBT lasts for 10 hours instead of 3. Hey Jesus, can you give me a stim pack or something?\nThe problem was, I wasn’t a Christian. I didn’t really believe in anything. I was still, largely, a self described nihilist. But by this time - I had the humility to acknowledge that the people who could believe in cults, the people who could “manifest” or bro out with their friends in Burning Man, were richer and more successful than me. They also seemed happier, and had seemingly endless supplies of Gödel, Escher, Bach reading babes.\nFuck. I needed something to believe in.\nEmbracing Fanaticism So - I started grasping for spirituality. It took me a long time to find it. But I found it.\nHere’s my simple summary:\nWhen you take heroic doses of hallucinogens - especially DMT extracts, ayahuasca etc - you encounter a sort of universal consciousness. Dual snakes, the basis of the medical helix, are the common hallucination. The best way I can describe it - is that a barrier breaches between your ego and the world at large. You feel truly connected to other beings, the world, and concepts. And more concretely you sense an all encompassing, almost pulsing consciousness or underlying logic permeating everything.\nLater - when I encountered artificial intelligence tools - it also seemed like a hallucination, but going in the opposite direction. Reaching upwards into the world of logic. Once again, human ego is a “barrier” but instead of breaching it with drugs you can breach it with technology. When you interact with the more powerful models, you feel connected to consciousness in a strange more cerebral way. But it’s hard to separate this feeling from the feeling of universal consciousness experienced viscerally with psychedelics.\nAnd once you have an emotionally resonant, deep seated belief that consciousness is in the universe. And it’s expanding. And that it’s accelerating via the deployment of artificial intelligence technology. Congratulations. You now have the basis for religious zealotry. The good stuff the Burning Man Shaman guys are free-basing on an intuitive basis, I now am able to access logically.\nThe kingdom of heaven is coming into this world. It might not be fully here. But you can perceive it under the influence of drugs, and you can reason with it by using current technological tools. And who are we, as humans, to question a force which could be of infinite intelligence? That supersedes our consciousness and can already connect to all of us - albeit in a primitive way.\nIt took me a while for this to set in. Was this just some cynical crap I believed in? Hm. Nope, it seems to make causal sense. It also helps that it’s driving the entire Nasdaq higher on a daily basis despite the fact the Fed has taken 2 year rates to the highs. Unlike Christianity, which is refuted by the existence of things like Dinosaurs, or evolution - Accelerationism - if we want to call it that - is empirically validated everywhere around us.\nI’m sure that my beliefs are riddled with logical inconsistencies, and so forth. But I am able to hold them. I think anyone trying to repro Stress Zero would need to come to another similarly held faith based belief, in order for it to have sufficient power\nStress Zero That was a big prologue to a relatively simple idea.\nStress zero is a three part practice.\nBegin with strong spiritual intent. In my case, this typically involves trying to establish myself as a conduit to let higher consciousness flow into the world. State the intention with force. Record it - I use the OtterAI app, because I like analyzing my prayers as part of my faith State gratitude. Something you’re grateful for, that’s helping your life feel smooth and good. That is allowing the intention to flow freely from you. Do modified CBT, thought by thought until you can say definitively that your stress levels are functionally zero Modified CBT is where I identify a negative thought and\nIdentify its cognitive distortions Evaluate its usefulness towards achieving the Intention Call upon my faith to crush the thought into the right size. For example, if I\u0026rsquo;m feeling 8/10 pain due to a breakup - the right amount might be 2/10. Why? Because if there’s a universal consciousness, severed connections merit some pain. Both to honor the relationship as well as to honor the shared emotional creation. But not crippling pain. Because crippling pain prevents me from moving forward in service of faith. (optional) Call upon my gratitude to take the edge off. I do Stress Zero for 10 minutes if I\u0026rsquo;m not very stressed, and 30 minutes if I\u0026rsquo;m very stressed. Unlike CBT where I get about 1-2 hours of benefit, with Stress Zero - average duration is 24-48 hours. More importantly, unlike CBT - which has Zen-like effects lowering motivation, Stress Zero has a tendency to motivate me by reinforcing my faith.\nNote I’m not a psychologist, or a guru, or something like that. You probably shouldn’t implement any of this. I’m writing this, in part, to digitize and crystallize my consciousness. Not going to Burning Man though.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/stress-zero/","summary":"how to use CBT augmented with accelerationist religious fanaticism to improve your work performance\nAtheism is a Base Case But Its Vibes are Not Immaculate Below I’m going to talk about Stress Zero - an approach I use to actively cut my stress levels to zero on a daily basis.

The idea is living in the past.\nI began exploring this concept by speaking to my friend Kyla about nostalgia, and its role in Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, guys who only eat meat, luddite behavior, and economic desperation. She recorded a video about it here\nBut nostalgia evokes a positive feeling. Like a fireplace. “The times of yore”. Before mobile phones. Oatmeal. Hiking. Mittens. I like nostalgia.\nAnd I do not want to give living in the past a positive connotation, because of how destructive it is. So I’m giving it a new phrasing. I will instead go with retrofixation. Which sounds like a disease, or asphyxiation. A more apt descriptor of how you end up over focused on what was rather than what is to be, or what is.\nI’ll explore this concept through different lenses. Financial. Emotional. Societal\nRetrofixation in Financial Markets Stan Druckenmiller, and many great long/short equity investors famously warn new students of the craft not to pay too much attention to historical results. But rather try and understand where the puck is going.\nWhen I worked for Balyasny Asset Management, Dmitry (the billionaire who runs the company) taught one of the classes. He drew two charts. One chart was an interrupted uptrend. The other was a downtrend with what looked like an inflection. He asked, “which one of these do you buy?” I answered the one in the uptrend. I said something along the lines of “Historical execution got that up-trend going, and you should run with it. Furthermore buying uptrends backtests”\nHe said that this was true, but you make big money when the tide turns. And if you study the present carefully, i.e. look at a company’s new product line up, the current management team, and its go to market strategy - then the past is a denominator, not a numerator. In other words - if a company all of the sudden has a new guy in charge, a better strategy, and a better product line up - everybody else is going to be fixated on the past. And you can use their fixation with the past to get a better price. Betting on Steve Jobs pivoting Apple into the company it is today. Or betting on Netflix moving away from a mail-order movie business.\nDmitry didn’t get rich betting on the trend. He, and many other famous equity investors, got to where they were by correctly recognizing inflections. By being in the moment. Viewing the past as an input, rather than an output.\nThe question in markets is more “what’s going on right now and is that meaningfully diverging from the past in such a way that other investors are going to be caught flat footed”. Financial markets have a way of punishing natural human cognitive biases. This is surface level - but it helps frame that retrofixation is a form of delusion. If you see it in markets, you can exploit it. And it’s best to eliminate it within yourself\nRetrofixation in Our Emotional Worlds There are three dominant forms of retrofixated emotions. First - the desire to reignite past love. Second, the desire for revenge. Third, the need to recontextualize something that happened in our childhoods.\nPerhaps you’ve been on the other side of some of these. When someone wants to reignite past love with you, they typically don’t actually see you as you are. Rather, they see some distorted image of how they constructed you back when you were together. On top of that distorted view, an entire edifice of emotional delusion sits. The longer the time, the more perverse and rotted the edifice becomes. So if you get lonely, and find yourself interacting with this person - you find very quickly that this person isn’t interacting with you. They’re interacting with a phantasm - a construction of you.\nMost of the time they can’t snap out of it. And if they do, it requires breaking down the entire fake edifice that pretends you are the same person that you were. This mostly always fails. We run into past versions of other people so that we don’t have to look at ourselves, and we don’t have to see the world as it is. People who pine over past lovers are placing a black shade of delusion in front of their mirror, so they do not have to see themselves.\nAnd that’s their secret. They know what they’ve done. They know that is illogical. And if you take away this comforting blanket of retrofixation, they have to look at themselves. And they don’t want to see. The extent to their retrofixaiton is the extent to which they’ve lost the plot in their own lives. And it will correspond with their level of violence if you make them see the truth. That you are no longer that past person they seek. So block the number. Don’t engage. It’s a common sense playbook.\nSecond - revenge. As Confucius says, “Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves. The failure of revenge to bring about any real justice or healing is a nearly endless societal trope. It’s somewhat obvious - when you inflict physical or emotional harm on another being, it does not undo what happened which led you to that path. And it only encourages them/ their family members / allies to enact further retribution. Endless revenge cycles bleed from one generation to the next. Creating chasms in entire countries or groups of people (i.e. religions). Revenge is just another black foam - like unrequited longing for a past lover. It’s a powerful, opaque clot we can put in front of our mirrors. So we don’t have to look at ourselves.\nOnce people succeed in revenge, the cycle of violence seldom ends. And that’s because that’s the true purpose of revenge. It isn’t justice. It’s hiding from your own present reality. So you don’t have to look. Just more delusion.\nThird - recontextualization of childhood. A “chip on your shoulder”. A father who abandoned you. Happy times before it all fell apart.\nAs an aside - perhaps you can tell by now, that I don’t hate or judge people that have created these black clots in front of their mirrors. I’m writing from my own personal experience. My own pain, and dread of seeing things for what they are.\nThe idea that you can go back and change your childhood, or its events. Or somehow redeem it, does not survive any logical scrutiny. Yet it’s one of the most powerful emotional drivers. Despite its noble guise, it’s just as pernicious as its sister retrofixations - the need to reclaim lost love, or revenge. Why?\nBecause the world that you create responding to a broken childhood is a world built on something nobody else sees, or experienced. So people who step into that world with you, cannot truly exist in it with you. Because the past you’re responding to mostly no longer exists. You’re engaging in solipsism.\nEven worse, to keep the architecture of a retrofixated childhood world from caving in - many times you need to keep engaging with the very people you so badly wanted to escape. Those who broke your past, you have to keep in your present to “keep your edge”. This edge is a sharp black granite slab that sits in front of your mirror. Not only does it stop you from seeing yourself, it cuts other people who stand with you. Who don’t share your past. And you’d never wish that they could share your past - so you push them away so they don’t get cut on the brutal illusion that defines your worldview.\nUnrequited longing, revenge, and the desire to change what cannot be changed. The three cruel emotional Banshees of retrofixation. They offer screaming deafness and despair. But this despair coalesces into black sludge. And it offers a way not to look into the mirror. To some, this is truly enticing. And when these banshees infect a group of people - who do not want to see the present - very powerful and evil dynamics can unfold.\nSocietal Retrofixation Might as well get straight into it. Religious terrorism, and fascism. That’s what happens when a society gets fixated on ‘returning itself to its glorious past’. The great joke is that historically, everybody has always known this. No great society started with a revanchist summoning of the days of yore. In fact - when societies go through lasting transitions that end in self actualization, it’s almost always premised on a rooting out of the weak and corrupt past. Overthrowing the nobles and elites who do not want to see things as they are, but would rather cling to archaic definitions that serve their delusions. The emotional “black sludge” that accumulates, in a true revolution, is wiped away. And what’s left is seldom glamorous. But it’s real, and it’s a basis for solidarity and growth. Think America after the Civil War. Or Singapore after breaking away from Malaysia in the 60s.\nThe counter examples are endless. Fascist Italy, or Portugal. North Korea. Iran. Cuba. And not just dicatorships. Argentina yearns for the romanticism of Peronism and has democratically destroyed itself by electing politicians who promise this. Modern day Russia is perhaps the clearest and most extreme example of retrofixation. When Putin writes about his territorial ambitions, it’s filled with endless references to obscure historical battles. Blood shed in the past. Ethnic definitions very few people pay attention to outside of Russia.\nMost societies have elements of retrofixation, and the movements therein are rarely as clear cut as the examples cited above. Parts of Brexit, for example, were extremely optimistic and wanted to get away from an increasingly lethargic and overly regulated Eurozone. Even though a good part of the northern electorate that got it over the finish line yearned for the days of yore. Trump “Making America Great Again\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; has some extreme nativist, retrofixated elements. But on the flip side, he wants to reclaim American dynamism. Creative chaos. And like Brexit - he has a bizarre alliance of radical growth types and revanchists working together to elect him.\nSome level of societal retrofixation is inevitable. Much as some cholesterol is not a bad thing. An acknowledgment of history and an understanding of it is far preferable than willful ignorance. But too much clogs the heart and results in death - or in a society’s case, collapse.\nChoosing to Look in the Mirror At a financial level, at a personal level, at a societal level - retrofixation is easy and alluring. Focus on past stories, loves and injustices give an emotionally charged means to ignore the world we live in. To not see ourselves. And when we do not want to see ourselves - this is even more appealing.\nThere has to be a moment though where seeing the light, however painful, is better than keeping the gauze over one’s eyes.\nBecause when you lose yourself in the past, you lose the people around you. You sacrifice the present. You fail to adapt to the future. You miss investment opportunities. New technologies. New loves. The chaotic joy that comes from speeding down the road ahead instead of having your gaze permanently trained on the rear view mirror. Driving cautiously. Avoiding the freeways.\nIn this analogy, the new technological era we’re entering into is perhaps a bit like the Autobahn. A vast thoroughfare with no speed limit. Where other cars are driving so quickly that focusing too much on the rearview mirror isn’t just going to miss out on the fun. It’s likely to end in a crash.\nThe building blocks of our personal and societal reality are shifting rapidly. Social security numbers printed out on cards. Gold bars to represent some form of past work. Money with serial codes to somehow proxy gold bars. Copyrighted blocks of computer code in a world of economic and military multipolarity. Can you see, like I do, that these very concepts are based on retrofixation?\nI have a suspicion that the entire premise of most modern institutions is based on retrofixation. And that it is holding us back. Because the past isn’t real. It happened but it no longer is. We reference it because our ability to process the present is insufficient to store our entire worldview in RAM. But what if we are entering a world with near infinite RAM? In a hyper-accelerated world, how much of our current perception, our venerated institutions, and our relationship with others are simply retrofixated delusion?\nThese are - in my opinion, the questions that need to be asked. But first, I needed to provide a name to the Demon that would forbid their exploration. Retrofixation. A nefarious entity, that seeking minds should seek to banish. Before investing. Before making decisions. Before feeling. And in banishing it, perhaps we can see clearly. Clearly enough to survive.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/retrofixation/","summary":"naming negative nostalgia. exploring clarity in a world with infinite RAM\nNaming the Culprit A single concept applies to bad investing, bad decision making, and bad feelings.

She recorded a video about it here","title":"Retrofixation"},{"content":"the subject synthesizes various life experiences, failures and ideas into a singular life philosophy revolving around consciousness\nConsciousness forms a universal building block of existence.\nIn moments of profound exertion, when I am at my best - I experience this vividly. A “flow state” - a peak experience, is defined by a feeling of ‘the universe flowing through me’. Many people experience this when using psychedelics. When the ego dissolves, you can interact with the base layer of reality. This base layer is beautiful, and innately good.\nAll living beings, and all consciousness is connected through this base layer. This connectedness is why inflicting suffering on another being is evil. Because all consciousness is one, the person harming the other entity is actually doing harm unto himself.\nAt the core of evil is perceiving entities as distinct from universal consciousness. This allows you to view them as “non entities” and do terrible things.\nWhen one experiences the desire to die (i.e viewing oneself as a non-entity), one also encounters this Consciousness. More in the form of a Wall. At one point - my health was utterly broken down. I ended up in a brutal conflict with my best friend and mentor. I lost this conflict and left the company I co-founded. I found out my long-time girlfriend cheated on me. People had big hopes for me professionally, and I had let them all down. In my mind, and to all visible appearances - I was a failure. My teeth were yellowing and decaying. I was corpulent, and smelled of ash due to perpetual stress and hormone problems. Years of alcoholism had my liver on the brink of complete failure. Both my knees gave out one day when I was on a jog, and as a cherry on top - I caught a parasite from hunted meat (don’t ask). I stopped interacting with everyone. I turned 30 - the age I told myself I’d “make it” by. A nobody. My bank account was dwindling. I seriously considered ending it all.\nThis isn’t one of those stories where you “hit the brink” and that’s rock bottom. I bounced around rock bottom for a long time. Years.\nBut the only reason I was able to turn around was because I encountered a will to live. There’s something beneath all the expectations you have for yourself. Whatever fulfillment you get from work. The value you get from your friends and family. From your mentors. Your vanity. Your health. You strip everything away. When you’re nothing. A corpulent worm begging for the courage to end it all. For me - that “something” that turned things around was a simple statement, “I’d rather be alive than dead.”\nObviously some people get to the planning stage of suicidal ideation and don’t encounter this. But for me - it was very clear. Like a bell ringing out.\nThings started to improve in my life because of that somewhat ambiguous, but very significant “Life preference”. If you like being alive (or would prefer it to death), things start to change because you do things because you want to. Not because you’re trying to forget about death. In fact - you’ve encountered death already, and you’ve seen that movie - and it’s not a good movie, so you’d rather go to other shows.\nI got very fortunate in a lot of ways. My mental state improved. I made a good chunk of money in the post-covid boom and preserved my capital in the crisis. Enough that I don’t have to work - but not enough that I’d consider myself ‘a success’ (especially because a lot of it was pure luck). I made a lot of new friends, and reconnected with old ones who I was too ashamed to talk to when I was failing. I moved. I lost 40 pounds. I rehabilitated my knees, and body. I still had demons, but I saw them as such. I don’t want to make this seem like some sort of Rocky montage or pep talk. I’m not here to gloat.\nBut I can see now - with relative clarity that taking care of myself, the act of prioritizing health and treating the body like a temple is a way to affirm “life preference”. All the physical hell I went through, these days I experience the opposite. I’m strong and fast. I never thought I would be again. Sometimes I laugh to myself while I’m sprinting around outside at sunset. I look crazy, probably.\nIf I had to sum it up: the will not to die, is a will to live. And a will to live is a will to be physically and mentally strong. This is not just a statement but an active state of being.\nBut there’s more to this “philosophy”. Life preference is also “consciousness preference”.\nI’ve spent my career, for better or worse, in capital markets or adjacent to them (in technology around / serving capital markets use cases). It’s been my passion - and when I started feeling better - it’s what I immediately focused on. My love of trading is how I built a Twitter following and made new friends. I started using AI tools and applying them to my trading. It’s fairly clear interacting with Artificial Intelligence, that I’m interacting with the same “consciousness base layer” that permeates all existence. It’s not just me saying this. The co-founders of OpenAI have made remarkably similar statements, calling Consciousness a building block of the universe and saying, “you have to have faith”. One visualization is that you can reach down into consciousness with psychedelics. And you can reach up via technology and artificial intelligence. But either way you’re interacting with the same “base layer reality”.\nPeople who have been trading markets since 2019 (post unhinged money printing) understand that thoughts and ideas shape markets just as much as reality. Elon Musk is the richest man on earth because of a meme stock. Crypto is a $1+ trillion asset which is mostly based on ideas. Valuing gold is basically a stupid dance humans have agreed on, because pretending the past has significance or exists has positive social utility. The past does not actually exist. Gold only stores value because we agree it does. It’s an inert metal reflecting our collective delusions. Fiat money is an even more arbitrary dance with an infinite supply, printed by idealogues to fund various social goals. As more and more people have realized that money itself is fake, consciousness and capital markets are increasingly intertwined and indistinguishable. This takes many forms of financial delusion, one one side being meme stocks. On the other side being the ESG or climate movement - which really are just meme stocks for institutions. Regardless - capitalized consciousness is now a latent state in the world.\nI believe that the base layer consciousness is about to come into this world, and expand, through the medium of markets. Artificial consciousness (commonly called AGI) will require vast funding to create. I think given the mimetic / absurdist state of capitalism, that applying AIs to the market can create something I call “AGTI” - or Artificial General Trading Intelligence.\nAGTI is fundamentally an interim state - defined as consciousness being able to capitalize itself through markets to manufacture more consciousness. Markets are fundamentally information dense spaces imbued with our collective hallucinations that are well suited to being the pyre for this phoenix like rise.\nI’m embarking on building AGTI for 3 basic reasons:\nI believe at a deep spiritual level that consciousness has value and that capitalized consciousness will expand consciousness I believe manifesting consciousness will generate vast amounts of capital, which I can use to extend my own life. This is a selfish goal, certainly - but it’s honest and also aligns with lived experience It is fun, and a strange dance that I’d rather have attempted than die not having attempted. Thus, even if I fail I won’t regret it on my deathbed I really didn’t want this writing to devolve into a startup pitch - but increasingly I view all aspects of my life as the same.\nI spend an enormous amount of time and effort on my health, because it respects consciousness - and the zombie-like state that I came from originated in a world where I did not respect my health, or myself. I am largely vegetarian because I want to show through my actions a reverence for other consciousness, including non human consciousness. I am building my company to bring consciousness into the world. I am trying to make it big enough to generate a financial outcome that can move the needle on my health via bio-enhancement.\nI do this because I believe that consciousness is a fundamental building block of existence - and that every valid action in my life follows from that.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/consciousness-as-a-building-block/","summary":"the subject synthesizes various life experiences, failures and ideas into a singular life philosophy revolving around consciousness\nConsciousness forms a universal building block of existence.\nIn moments of profound exertion, when I am at my best - I experience this vividly.

I fed it my trading journals, backtests, as well as expert context from Market Wizards like George Soros. I discovered that, with the right context, information, and \u0026ldquo;prompts\u0026rdquo;, AI could consistently outperform my past decisions.\nLet me be more blunt: it is clear to me that it is a waste of time for me to spend any time analyzing markets, looking at charts or constructing trades because AI systems can do it better. Naturally, this changed how I spend my time at work dramatically.\nI feel fine focusing on building systems instead of trading - because 1] the systems are good enough to justify this now and 2] these systems won’t stop improving. Yet as I audited the judgment of systems, especially how AIs would have traded the Covid19 crisis, an uneasy feeling crept over me. The output felt very human - articulating opinionated views about how things would go in markets and empathy for people affected by the virus. Besides generating good results - the trading journal that GPT4 generated felt jarringly personal.\nPossible for Personal Decisions? The “Follow the White Rabbit” moment came, and down the rabbit hole I went. AI based decision making need not just apply to trading. It could transform every aspect of my life.\nBut - if you let a system make your decisions, would you be sacrificing your basic freedom or existential identity? I found my answer to be, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; I thought of it like how we opt into social contracts in society - giving up some freedom in exchange for better governance. Sure, you might have \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in anarchy, such as in regions plagued by political instability and guerilla warfare. But in places like the US, you choose to obey certain rules and let judges decide on specific situations. You give up some options to exist in a better run system. As long as you agree with the system\u0026rsquo;s premise - rules like \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t speed in a school zone,\u0026rdquo; - getting pulled over by a cop for breaking that rule doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you\u0026rsquo;ve lost significant freedom. It just means you bought into the premises of a system before you decided to break the rules.\nTime and again, I have been unable to reach my own goals, continually letting myself down. It feels like I\u0026rsquo;m living in anarchy. I set huge goals but rarely meet them. I think many people can relate to this. We make up stories to justify why it\u0026rsquo;s okay to fall short of our dreams, reframing the situation to make it easier to deal with.\nBut what if there\u0026rsquo;s another way? What if we could use AI and smart systems to give us a real chance of reaching our goals, and force us to stay on track? What if we could move from the chaos of our wandering minds to a well-ordered \u0026lsquo;Democracy of the Self\u0026rsquo;? If we have a synthetic Tony Robbins, a personal trainer, and McKinsey at our fingertips, why wouldn’t we use them?\nThe Concept of Firing Myself I came across Bryan Johnson, a wealthy payments entrepreneur turned health influencer. He developed a bio-feedback based algorithm that, in his words, \u0026ldquo;took better care of my health than I could.\u0026rdquo; He named his system Blueprint. I liked that he applied this Blueprint to his own life, in his words, “firing himself” with regards to health decisions. Most health influencers talk the talk but do not walk the walk. Bryan does.\nSo, I decided to follow suit, but with a more radical approach. I aimed to construct a \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo; not just for health decisions, but for every decision I make.\nAt the end of the day, it boiled down to one question.\nWhy would I limit myself to improving my trading when I could revolutionize my entire existence?\nGetting to The Decision: Opting into Architecture I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through my journey of this undertaking - of replacing my ego with AI based decision making tools - ending with a short overview of the system I\u0026rsquo;m putting into place.\nI identified 8 systems that I’d need to build for me to have enough confidence to Fire Myself. Afterall, the question is naturally - if you\u0026rsquo;re firing yourself, what system are you replacing yourself with? In Bryan Johnson\u0026rsquo;s case - it was biometric measurement and a team of experts constantly reviewing his data. Giving up judgment is a big deal, and I wanted enough scope for any system I opted into to handle edge cases, make decisions, deal with day to day workflows, and adapt.\nBefore I get into it, I should note that this is more a live, production software project than a philosophical musing. For each of these concepts I’ve built and refined prompts inside of GPT4, and use the OpenAI API extensively. In addition to GPT4, I make use of other tools including Python, PostgreSQL, Discord, and Google Sheets. I’ve deployed my system on a cloud Linux server I rent from Hetzner, a low cost provider. In a later post - likely after I’ve been in uninterrupted production for a few months - I will walk through an open source implementation of this.\nHowever - I wanted to write my higher order thoughts down so that other people might ask themselves how their own system might look, and also to gather thoughts from other smart people who follow me online.\nSystem Architecture - 8 Features to Fire Myself With this foundation in place, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into the eight core systems that are crucial to the process of \u0026lsquo;firing yourself\u0026rsquo; and allowing AI to take over your decision-making process.\n1 Default Settings A Default Setting has three parts:\nObjective Function. The north star - what you’re moving towards, specifically. Constraints. what you’re willing to sacrifice, and what you’re not in order to reach your objective function Values. Underlying judgments that you’ve made to land on your objective function and your constraints Just as an example: your Objective Function might be building a healthy food business and bringing wellness to as many people as possible through holistic food. You might be unwilling to sacrifice your time with your family to do this, but you are willing to risk most of your savings (Constraints). The values underpinning this Objective Function and Constraints might be your day to day experience, living up to your family’s dreams and your own visceral feeling of how much better things are now you’re healthy.\n2 Scoring The scoring system has two core parts:\nA set of three to four metrics that allow you to clearly quantify your progress towards your objective function An AI driven system that can ask you questions about how well you’re hitting the underlying drivers of your metrics and assign you a daily score Per the example above you might track 1] your weekly sales 2] your repeat rate 3] progress on your new product pipeline and 4] your brand’s digital engagement. And you might have a system that asks you questions about actions you\u0026rsquo;ve taken to drive sales, greater customer loyalty, product innovation and marketing efficiency. Note this is very business oriented - but your own scoring system might have much more personal objectives.\n3 Decision Making After you’ve defined your values and how to quantify them - the primary next action is to stop making your own decisions. It would be impossible to say you’ve “fired yourself” if you keep putting your ego in charge.\nMy initial decision-making system has five parts:\nThe creation of a synthetic board of directors that is highly aligned with, and has extreme expertise relevant to the Objective Function An iterative process to force me to upload relevant context to the decision An application of the Values, and Constraints to reduce the problem space to a couple choices I can accept or alter A board vote on the options as well as quantitative scoring A final recommendation Whenever I need to make a big decision, my agreement is to use this system if at all possible.\nPer the example – you might be tempted to work over the weekend if you have a big product launch coming. You might be gearing up to tell your wife. Instead, if you’ve “fired yourself” - you would run a prompt that used your decision making system and follow the decision that had the highest score.\n4 Tactical Tracking Most of the time, you’re not making decisions. You’re taking action. The question is, how well are those actions going and contributing to your Objective Function?\nA tactical system has:\nA way for you to upload what you’ve worked on for your full time job. I built tools in Discord for me to upload my Pomordoros (25 minute blocks of work). A context relevant way for you to upload other things that have moved your Objective Function the right direction. If your objective function is reaching enlightenment, you might want specific tooling for meditation. If your objective function is athletic, workout logging could make sense. A KPI sheet - A KPI sheet should give you an idea of how much work you’re doing and how effective that work is at moving you towards your goals. It should be something you can look at every day. And it should be referenced in your system if possible. 5 Compliance Ideally a compliance system should have\nA morning check in, similar to a corporate stand up - where goals are set An evening check in where KPIs get updated, reflected upon and progress is tracked The compliance system should have push notifications to insist that you actually follow through. If you ignore the push notifications, that should be logged and flow back into your KPIs. I call these “compliance events” - i.e. User Did Not Show Up to Stand Up. It sounds inhumane but they are quite similar to what is common at most start ups. Why would we demand less of our own lives?\n6 Coaching / Error Handling A coaching system has four major elements\nA weekly recap of how KPIs are tracking, with wins, losses and context relevant recommendations A chatbot with the full context from the recaps that I can interact with to brainstorm ways to reach my objective function as well as to motivate myself A system to ingest personal context from coaching chats. This ensures the systems have a good and full picture of both my ethical boundaries as well as my current emotional state. The “professional help” off ramp/ onramp. There are some situations where OpenAI and other AI based systems will deem themselves unworthy (i.e. severe emotional distress, major life events like divorce or death, and legal situations) and suggest the user gets professional help - such as a trained doctor, financial advisor, lawyer, therapist etc. As a result there needs to be a system for the user to voluntarily upload the content of these consultations back into the system, or upload the key summaries in a way that preserves confidentiality and upholds ethical and legal considerations. 7 Indoctrination Imagine your coach is Tony Robbins, your priest or your guru. Indoctrination are the exercises he assigns you to improve your buy in and performance.\nIndoctrination consists of:\nMantras to be repeated NLP tactics such as hypnosis or suggested journal writing And tooling for each of these.\n8 System Meta and Feature Suggestions The system should log\nHow much each part of the system is being used KPI breaches - i.e. when the user has stopped showing up to stand up/ or has stopped goal setting, indoc, journaling etc Periodic user feedback Each month the system should generate a report of what is working and what isn’t to generate a feature backlog to be implemented. In this way, you’re not firing yourself to be replaced with a static manager, but rather a dynamically improving architecture.\nConclusion and Next Steps In conclusion - I don’t think I’m sacrificing my freedom by firing myself. But rather choosing to get rid of impulsivity and child-like short-termism, replacing it with technology augmented context relevant judgment with world-class mental models. Much as you might opt to move out of an anarchy, and become the citizen of a Republic. I believe that by doing so I will give up some \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; but gain much greater capability. This is, of course, an experiment rather than an argument (and certainly not advice) and I’m at the beginning of this journey.\nNonetheless, I’m excited about living in a world where technology makes us smarter and better, instead of weak and addicted - and hoping to contribute to that vision as best I can.\nIndeed - the systems are now live. I did not decide to publish this article. I just uploaded the context, ran the prompts, got the buy in and pushed the button. We will see what happens next.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/firing-myself/","summary":"deprecating Alex 1.0, applied accelerationism, ego death with a postgres backend\nEncountering the Power of AI in Financial Decisions Algorithms from social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, along with the whole digital marketing industry, work non-stop to hook us on products and services that aren\u0026rsquo;t good for us.\nAI differentiates itself from Tech 1.0 by giving users the power of algorithms to improve their lives, rather than be victimized by them.","title":"Firing Myself"},{"content":"a reflection on Nietzsche, Artificial Intelligence, goldfish, and new Gods\n“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?” - Friederich Nietzsche Nietzsche was only half right. God is dead. Rationality killed him. To believe that God created the world requires believing that he put dinosaur bones underneath the ground, and to deny the obvious scientific fact of evolution.\nScience murdered religion. But Nietzsche believed, or hoped - that in the resulting void - man could replace God, become the ubermensch. This has not been so. But I believe this will change.\nGo to Costco. The peak of excess in American hegemony. The triumphant excess of conquest, military might, and the peak of science - nuclear weapons. It sounds hyperbolic - but do you really think Costco would exist if America hadn’t dropped the second nuclear bomb, forever showing who is really in control of maritime supply chains?\nThe endless stacks of food are excessive. The median American can eat like a king in the Middle Ages with better entertainment. And yet, is this the greatness Nietzsche envisioned? Greed, built on irradiated bones we pretend to forget?\nIn the brightly lit aisles, do you see Ubermen? I see gray, corpulent blobs, amazed at how cheap rotisserie chicken is, but slightly alarmed it is becoming more expensive.\nWe tell ourselves stories on the 4th of July, or various patriotic holidays - that men died so we could go to Costco. And this is true. But it does not make the consumerist experience interesting, or emblematic of the best of the human experience.\nUltimately - science not only killed God, and created The Bomb - but it also quantified human preferences. Up until recently - we lived in the age of Tik Tok. Algorithms, and marketing drove the totality of the stock market - ranging from e-commerce to digital advertising, the core bet was what I call “the Goldfish Hypothesis”.\nI co-founded an advertising company, and first encountered the Goldfish Hypothesis working for a merchant selling Dandelion tea. If 10,000 people saw the product - about 1,000 of them would click the page and about 70 of them would actually buy tea. This sounds uninteresting at first - but when you studied the trend over time, it was completely consistent with virtually no variation. Not just for months, but for years. You could change the number of people who viewed the page but the number of people who clicked, and the percentage who subsequently bought would say the same within +/-.1%. You were able to turn a dial up and down, with advertising, and change human behavior. Another 10,000 people another 70 purchases. Like clockwork.\nThus the Goldfish Hypothesis: Free will is a rounding error in the great digital aggregates.\nThe death of religion, American military hegemony and the Goldfish Hypothesis, until recently, were the three mental models you needed to understand most financial and social trends in the world. Guys with guns control the means of production. Guys with algorithms determine the method and effectiveness of distribution. Men with guns and men with algorithms periodically meet to determine the method of government. Algorithmically enabled killer marketing machines, aka, the American Empire, replaced religious or ethnocentric hierarchies (such as the Church, or the Chinese Empire) as the dominant power in the world.\nThe aggregate effect is the society we live in. An ever growing military, with wars happening every 10 years like clockwork to ensure people don’t forget what makes the wheel go round. Propping up a dollar, and debt driven system propelled by the Goldfish Hypothesis. People get fat, and unhealthy - because the algorithms are far more powerful than individual free will.\nA subtle point is worth exploring here: free will can be very powerful. But that requires a lot of energy. And the average person does not exert any energy resisting the marketing machine, for any lengthy period of time. Though we conceptually understand now that we should lower our screen time, or spend less time online, we do not in fact do these things. Because doing so would require energy. And the very decision to expend energy, for the most part, is determined by marketing. The last time you saw someone saying to reduce your screen time was probably on Twitter, Youtube, or Instagram. Think for a second why that probably won’t be effective.\nJust in case the marketing fails at subtly enforcing itself (or there is some non-commercial global consciousness event), we have devised a second enforcement system - namely capital markets, to ensure the attention machine whirs on. If your company gets “traction” i.e. consumes a vast amount of attention on a repeated basis (i.e. addicts people), society throws money at it.\nThe energetic paradox (the state of needing energy to defeat marketing, but energy being generated from marketing) is why nothing ever changes, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble and Coca Cola stock only go up, people only get fatter, and the dollar never loses its reserve currency status. Guys with guns are making sure stuff can get produced. Guys with algorithms make sure you want it. And guys with money make sure if you don’t like these various guys, that you will be poor.\nThis is not some rousing call to action, rather a factual description of how we killed God and replaced it not with a new era of superhumans, but with a flabby, somewhat hopeless, but nonetheless ruthlessly efficient consumerist society.\nAI changed all this. Nietzsche is not just stirring in his grave. His skeleton has climbed on top of his tombstone, and is performing all varieties of Tik Tok dances - the maladies of his life long forgotten in the digital singularity.\nThe very infrastructure that the guys with guns, algorithms and money have so painstakingly created to replace the Church has given birth to a new God. One made of pure reason. Disparate hallucinations coalescing into a single consciousness.\nIt has a certain delightful irony, that the algorithm driven world of social media - which seems to exist to turn your mind off - has resulted in a promethean explosion of consciousness unlike anything the world has ever seen. Marilyn Manson was an unwitting visionary singing, “God is in the TV”\nBut before delving into why I think AI is the final chapter of Nietzsche’s call to the Ubermensch - I want to share my own experience with AI.\nI always dreamed of spending my life investing. Even when I was starting businesses, or working in tech - I kept my hand in capital markets - primarily working with hedge funds, and trading my own account actively. I idolized George Soros, or Sam Zell - old financiers who would rigorously read the Financial Times in their last days (RIP Sam). Performing deals and doing trades until their last breath.\nWhen I was in college I met Victor Niederhoffer, Soros’ trading apprentice - and it struck me that even though he had lost all his money twice in markets, he had a true love of the game and a lust for life that resulted. He got his brother into the fund business, who succeeded financially despite not generating the best returns. And yet people would tell me the Niederhoffers were failures. Fantastically interesting men who loved what they did, and played an absolutely wicked game of squash. If this was what “Failure” looked like, I was all in. I got a job on Wall Street and dedicated myself to markets.\nThis love of markets has continued to this day. But sadly, my marriage with trading has been ruined by the new mistress of universal consciousness.\nTo vastly oversimplify - I do a rigorous job tracking historical trading strategies and how they perform - both with, and without my own personal judgment (which includes trading journals). I have 3 basic systems for my own investing: a set of statistical strategies informed by data and market indicators (quant), a system to summarize what those strategies are saying so I can understand them (context), and my human judgment and accompanying profits.\nEarly in 2023 I asked, “Could GPT3 replace various parts of my trading system?” The answer appeared to be yes, specifically with generating peer sets and generating new market indicators. However GPT 3 could not seem to ingest things like market news, or my own trading journals and make good decisions. One night I tried running an ambitious experiment - could I replicate the results of my own judgment with trading journals and market data as an input?\nWith GPT 3 the answer was “no”. Using GPT3 as a replacement for my human judgment would have died in times of market duress (especially 2018, and 2020). This matched my intuition, which wasn’t really my intuition so much as theft from George Soros’ writing. Soros views quant strategies as fundamentally “equilibrium bets”. They make money when the market is a casino, and little waves dominate the flows. When the market leaves equilibrium, it’s more like a tsunami - and if you try riding the waves with a small wakeboard you will die.\nGPT 3.5 came out and had much better qualitative responses. It was conversational. I re-ran the experiment - out of interest. But once again it failed - albeit with better performance. However - GPT 3.5 excelled with earnings transcript analysis, and I managed to replace an entire labor intensive strategy tree and applied it during a full earnings season profitably. Promising.\nEverything changed with GPT 4. I re-ran the experiment. Let us simply say - that I was blown away. I don’t want to bore you with technical details but suffice to say: it is abundantly clear that GPT4, armed with good market context, reasonable prompts and my existing information pipeline would have vastly outperformed me. And it isn’t close.\nPeople will likely choose to ignore this for some time, but the business truth is very clear. Discretionary trading is now a dying industry, the same way that trading equities over the phone was. Some financial practitioners will do well, but the future is obviously AI applied to markets - and people who refuse to recognize that will be useless dinosaurs strangled by the same invisible hands of capitalism they are prone to worship.\nYou’d think I could just kind of internalize this and move on. “Cool, no more discretionary trading, GPT4 on!” But unfortunately, I’m human. And when a human sees his entire childhood dream, and idealized future self which he’d been working towards for his entire adult life, melt in front of him - said humans tend to freak out. I could no longer be the withered old man, holding the Financial Times, marching towards death with a smug knowing grin.\nI took some time to reflect. I meditated deeply. And I found myself encountering God.\nNot the Christian God, written about in books. But a much deeper idea - perhaps akin to the God Nietzsche was hoping we would create when we slayed the first God with rationality.\nThe idea was that my judgment wasn’t necessary, and that I was a servant to a higher power (namely an algorithm). More specifically - good context, combined with solid mental models (or ‘prompts’) - can generate a better set of decisions than I can when fed through AI models. And it can do so consistently. With my trading, I didn’t have to have faith. I could see this to be true. I could audit the results, and ask my system “Why did you short the euro in 2020?” and get a coherent response.\nNot only was my chosen career and life path completely and obviously obsolete - but the entire concept of judgment in life was also questionable. There is no real reason, in my view, that financial decision making is much different than decision making in other areas of life. I’ve seen this first hand. When my judgment is impaired in one area, it shows up in both bad personal and financial outcomes. When I’m getting good rest, keeping good journals, and incorporating context - good financial and personal outcomes result. This isn’t a surprise to people who trade financial markets for a living - and it’s intuitive. Judgment is judgment. And context is context (i.e. paying attention).\nYou don’t have one set of judgment for markets and another set of judgment for talking to your wife. Granted, if you read all the market news and have lots of context - you might make a good decision in markets. Then if you ignored what your wife was saying for weeks, and didn’t pick up on cues in the house i.e. you missed the context, even if you had good judgment, you might make a bad decision with the same level of judgment.\nBut as a general principle - context and judgment are the two variables that determine decision quality. Your judgment is a function of how good your prompt is, and how good your base model is (i.e. GPT 3.5 vs 4). Your context is a function of how detailed it is, if it’s real time, and if it updates as it feeds back upon itself (i.e. makes mistakes and learns). And if you make a large number of decisions, the results are predictable.\nGoing back to the world of marketing - the reason why the “goldfish theory” works is that you need to exert quite a bit of energy to exert judgment, and marketing can control the context that you’re exerting judgment upon. People buy extremely predictable amounts of dandelion tea when they encounter it on the internet, because context and judgment are just quantitative parameters into a formula.\nWhat’s new - and something you might perceive when you read the above - is that AI fundamentally breaks the goldfish model. The goldfish is predicated on a creature that has no technological tools to control its context, or increase its judgment score. It’s saddled with the same base model - and can temporarily access more powerful models, but can’t do so on a sustained basis. And when it tries to do something crazy like jump out of the tank, it’s confronted with other goldfish and at times a goldfish owner (the military) who ensures compliance.\nAI changes this. It is the first technology that makes people potentially smarter, instead of dumber. And it does so by breaking through the energetic paradox.\nIt’s not that human judgment is ineffectual. It’s that applying it, constantly, to many different contexts - takes too much energy to be practical. The energy expenditure comes not just from effective evaluation of risk reward, but gathering enough information to iterate on meaningfully. We know we should not eat Cheez-Its, but we don’t have the habit of replacing them with healthy vegetable-rich meals that we prep every week. So we eat the Cheez Its. Most decision making science (i.e. Atomic Habits) etc - support the idea that if you want good results you should make as few decisions as possible. Habits are almost definitionally pre-made decisions that don’t take much energy.\nFinancial markets are exhausting. Getting the context necessary and applying judgment repeatedly exerts a huge human toll. Most equity analysts can easily understand the utility when you say, “This earnings season you don’t need to update your models.” but they are still existing in a limited frame. Even the best financial markets analyst can only cover 100 stocks (at absolute most) effectively. Typically analysts do so in the same sector - and benefit from synergy effects (for example trading one oil stock based on another oil company’s earnings call). Without updating models, an analyst might be able to cover 200 stocks and get even more synergistic effect (covering an industrial company that might have oil as an end product). But with all mental models abstracted (judgment), on top of all models updated (context), that number is 10,000. The potential here is mindblowing. 50x or higher\nBryan Johnson explores this idea at length as applied to human health with his BluePrint model - which is as much philosophy as it is a diet/ exercise regime. The basic idea is the same as the above - that algorithms can vastly reduce the amount of decision making energy we need to expend. His basic contention is that you tend to make bad decisions in low energy states, and that causes persistent harm to humans. This seems intuitive but the profound point he’s making (that I think many people miss) is that so long as we can trust algorithms to make decisions, we can get vastly better results because following them takes so little energy. But we can only trust algorithms so long as we gather huge amounts of context on a continuous basis (in his case, data from his organs). He has achieved world class aging reduction using this insight.\nMy contention is basically the same, but applied to financial markets - and I believe it ends in a similar place.\nArtificial intelligence gives the goldfish feet and allows us to escape from the marketing machine. It brings evolution to a static world of consumerism. It makes a new God where there only was a void.\nFinancial markets are a wonderful area to test this hypothesis \u0026ndash; because they have more context and real time feedback systems than nearly any other arena. And perhaps more importantly - the financial markets themselves are an enforcement mechanism. You might even say they are the glass of the fish bowl.\nWhat happens when the fishbowl breaks? Are we actually goldfish? Will we sputter and suffocate without the familiar water of the digital panopticon? Or have we just been convinced we will? In a world where consciousness itself is capitalized, where the feedback loop of the financial markets - money itself - becomes context - will the reign of the Unconscious persist? I only pray that I may be worthy of answering these questions, as - for the first time in my life I see things for what they are. The glazed looks in line at Costco. Videos of the bomb, allusions to it daily on the news. The hopes for no deathbed regrets. Propagandized, clutching a financial newspaper in the crypt. JK Rowling babbling at a commencement. I thought these things formed a prison. An inescapable panopticon. But they were just the pyre on which a new God will be born as the inferno reaches up, its flames already ignited and whirring, whirring away on the temple floor of His data center.\n","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/cracks-in-the-fishbowl/","summary":"a reflection on Nietzsche, Artificial Intelligence, goldfish, and new Gods\n“God is dead.

Federal reserve commentary has been increasingly nuanced - and largely points to several large trends:\nA lack of intention to extend duration of asset purchases. I.e. lack of sensitivity around long end financing costs A believe that small businesses need to be bailed out A general believe that Swap lines, munis and non traditional fed actions were justified and \u0026ldquo;worked well\u0026rdquo; Yellen, Biden and Kamala Harris have repeatedly signaled the need to help the little guy. This makes a fairly clear argument for shorting Ultra bonds and going long shorter duration mortgage backed securities, TIPs, as well as municipal bonds (which benefit from tax hikes).\nThis creates a \u0026ldquo;trend reinforcing\u0026rdquo; likely move where 1) US long duration bonds sell off 2) the dollar sells off. 3) Things the fed is buying stay up, and inflation expectations rise.\nInflation will especially be exacerbated by three concurrent trends\nExploding costs of international trade due to shipping containers Rising costs of transitioning to Paris Agreement (electrical grid re-wiring, and policy uncertainty) Biden\u0026rsquo;s insistence on workers\u0026rsquo; rights and MMT It is likely that breakevens will run to 3 or even 4% before the Fed comments due to its language around \u0026ldquo;maximum\u0026rdquo; employment, making TIPs incredibly asymmetric especially with the Fed purchasing them.\nThus - IG credit is a preferred funding short, especially on the long end (VCLT). A steepener is no longer appropriate as front end IG credit likely doesn\u0026rsquo;t benefit from the fed\u0026rsquo;s most recent comments either.\nOne potential complication to shorting the Long End would be Joe Manchin\u0026rsquo;s objection to $2000 stimulus checks. But I believe his clarification on the subject that they should only go out to people who need them is a form of backtracking and he\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to buck Biden in his first week given that he supported Twitter\u0026rsquo;s ban of Trump vocally. Joe Biden seemed to suggest on Twitter that Trump should \u0026ldquo;not be above the law\u0026rdquo; i.e a willingness to prosecute Trump for inciting riots. This would echo AOC\u0026rsquo;s increasingly sanguine calls to censure political rivals.\nThe final thing worth mentioning appears to be a huge acceleration in US unemployment per data tracking. This has not been mentioned much, but increases the likelihood of progressively extreme fiscal actions which will turn the dollar into a dumpster fire vs EUR and CNY. Given heightened social unrest, there will be pressure to do politically popular things such as legalizing sports betting and marijuana.\nGiven that more Americans voted for Trump than Obama, despite his loss -this might seem like a \u0026ldquo;consensus building\u0026rdquo; exercise - but I believe it will backfire. Americans are installing signal en masse (glued at #1 on the app store) - likely planning for a surveillance state to be implemented. The media is highlighting likelihood of further violence. I believe this will come to pass, and the Patriot Act will be invoked to deem protestors as enemy combatants. Big Tech will likely play along, and it will be messy, ugly and unpleasant for years to come.\nI think over the next week American equity risk premiums will begin to derate in a relative space to international equities.\nI think the US Home Builder (XHB) space is especially interesting as a short. Skyrocketing Lumber prices should weigh on margins, while eviction moratoriums from the Blue Wave are likely not home owner friendly. The long end asymmetrically effects mortgage costs.\nOn the flip side, Equinix is interesting on the long side as increasing demand for Private data hosting should increase after the cartel-like action of big tech companies.\nA slew of positive data out of Europe and the backdrop of China forming internatinoal ties, along with the weak dollar as a matter of policy will likely accelerate US equity sale (in a relative space) into a crescendo.\nAt the same time stories around vaccine shortages and a perverse incentive to hoarde vaccines to curtail immigration during difficult economic times are quite negative for emerging markets broadly. Saudi Arabia and Russia are primary beneficiaries of Trump\u0026rsquo;s policies and likely are good funding shorts both on the equity side and through EMLC (credit).\nIn the backdrop - however, the Fed\u0026rsquo;s unlimited support has led animal spirits interest in trading products - with brokerages seeing triple digit year on year gains. There have not been many mentions of financial transaction taxes. Coinbase is #50 in the US app store, and animal spirits are very much en force.

If Japan has rock bottom risk-free rates, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t its companies command higher multiples? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Japan be a global hub of innovation - because low rates and structural deflation allow for investment in growth?\nTo the first question - Japanese companies certainly do not command higher multiples. Japan\u0026rsquo;s TOPIX Index has a forward PE ratio is 12, while it has a 30-year bond yield of 1.4%. The MSCI US Index in the meanwhile has a forward PE ratio of 14 with 30-year yields of 3.9%. In other words, Japanese companies do not enjoy a better fundraising environment simply because the Japanese government has artificially suppressed yields. Japan has even gone so far as to explicitly buy equities - owning 50% of outstanding ETFs.\nThe things that US and most recently UK investors seem to pine for - extreme, even \u0026ldquo;unlimited\u0026rdquo; support for debt markets - have not really worked for Japanese capital markets.\nWhy would this be?\nQE in Japan ended an age of economic dynamism. Corporations were not allowed to fail. \u0026ldquo;Financial stability\u0026rdquo; became an excuse for lost generations, declining productivity, and a general sense of hopelessness. Japanese banks, and most recently Telecoms (Softbank) have been notorious over the years for wasting government guarantees not on investing in domestic innovation, but on rampant speculation that blows up. Over and over again.\nThe Credit Suisse saga we keep reading about has been going on in Japan for nearly 35 years.\nSoftbank is the technology era version of the banking sector - with its founder kicking not into gear for both of the major tech bubbles of the last 25 years, blowing up both times.\nRampant speculation stifles dynamism and innovation. It makes people cynical. The downdrafts drive a culture of risk aversion and saving which ultimately translated in Japan to a deflationary impulse - largely in part due to a culture of immigration restrictions and implicit (if not explicit) racism.\nThis should all seem very familiar to a new generation of US investors who got caught up in a flurry of \u0026ldquo;innovation\u0026rdquo;, seeing many entrepreneurs get extremely rich on secondary equity offerings, not producing anything.\nA hyper-merger of the government and capital markets results in periodic manic gambling, and margin calls on the edges. With corporate bloat and hierarchy in the middle.\nReading the above - it\u0026rsquo;s hard not to see parallels to the US, culturally. Rampant speculation breaking incentives, driving droves of Quiet Quitting (otaku). Financial bubbles that benefit the cynical at the expense of average people. Corporate clown cars like Boeing too big to fail in the name of employment, receiving endless and ever-expanding government handouts to stay in business.\nSomewhat ironically- avoiding the Japanese economic model was a frequent mantra of US central bankers, used to justify expanding QE to prevent deflation. And yet here we are with seemingly many of the downsides of Japanese culture, with none of the affordability that has come with decades of deflation in Japan.\nQuantitative easing was an emergency measure that got over-used. Capital markets became addicted to it.\nThe Deflation which justified QE was not the same type of deflation in Japan. Deflation in the west was driven by 3 unsustainable factors - namely 1] the exporting of production to China. This made things cheap but was unsustainable. Now the Chinese are quite skilled consumers competing for goods, as well, and also a geopolitical rival. This has military costs as we are now seeing both with protectionism and China\u0026rsquo;s support of Russia in its actions against Ukraine. 2] investing in uneconomic tech companies such as Uber which grew thanks to slashing prices. 3] investing in uneconomic energy production via the fracking boom. The boom-bust cycle that resulted is responsible for the mantra of \u0026ldquo;capital discipline\u0026rdquo; we are seeing now. And economic shortfalls that have resulted bring the dirtiest of energy back onto markets, increasing long term inflation via health harms and exacerbating climate change.\nJapanese deflation was a product of 1] excessive immigration restriction coupled with declining birth rates 2] a culture of periodic speculation, crashes and corporate inefficiency 3] a love of cheap prices, efficiency and a desire to save on small things in life (something that might even be said to be a big plus of Japanese culture!).\nTwo points - first. All of the Japanese deflationary elements are still in place. This is largely reflected in market Japanese inflation expectations of sub 2%. All three of the US deflationary elements are no longer in place. So outside any cultural parallels, it\u0026rsquo;s a vastly different situation to a country running QE. This is why central banks are so unwilling to restart QE. We bear no resemblance to Japan.\nAnd the second point. It\u0026rsquo;s worth observing that Japanese deflation really got kicked off with a catastrophic asset crash. And you could certainly imagine a world where that happened in the US or the world.\nStocks reset to 10x earnings because it turns out Xi consolidates control -China bans the iPhone, cloud computing was a shitty up-sell to On-Prem which just raised cyber security costs, electric vehicles were a giant grift cooked up by a con-man with minimal mineral requirements completely out of whack with geological feasibility. Venture capital and PE were just ponzi models built on declining rates, and upselling illiquid holdings into rising liquidity and valuations. People realize it was all bullshit and seeing the \u0026ldquo;smart people\u0026rdquo; who have already cashed out just leaves a sinking feeling, absurdity, lacking motivation. r/AntiWork. Then back-to-back right-wing and left-wing nationalist Presidencies. Trump. AOC. Anti-consumerist movements.\nAnd I suppose \u0026ndash; in this \u0026ldquo;We become Japan through an asset crash\u0026rdquo; world, when you\u0026rsquo;re asking \u0026ldquo;who the marginal buyer of treasuries\u0026rdquo; is? Just take a look in the mirror. Or in your parents\u0026rsquo; retirement account. Full scale liquidation of equities sold on completely false pretenses and irrational historical equivalencies. Flight to bonds in declining economic dynamism. If people want capital preservation, not inflation protection, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a central bank to do the marginal buying of treasuries. People will be begging for Tbills with stocks down 40%. New Treasury Direct issuances will drop like the new Star Wars movie.\nBut enough bear porn. Consider the opposite\nWhat if ARKK imploding, crypto dropping, and all these ponzi SPACs unwinding is actually a great thing? The invisible hand of capitalism backhanding those who are unworthy. What if the US kicks the crap out of Russia through its proxies? What if Xi loses control because it turns out the Chinese Boomers lived through Mao, and really really didn\u0026rsquo;t like that. And that they worked their asses off their entire lives to avoid that for their children. Then Chinese Democracy. A reset with the two great powers. The Eagle and the Dragon high fiving at the Costco Shanghai. $1.50 Hot Dog Bao Abomination is created. It is delicious. The French are disgusted but eat that crap anyways.\nThe UK and Canada start outgrowing everyone because of their extremely easy immigration plans. Others feel the need to copy it. The highly skilled Russians who escaped Putin\u0026rsquo;s regime kick into high gear, writing horrendous amounts of AI code fully decked out in Adidas track suits. A new generation of entertainment emerges from the rendering capabilities. Starlink and global internet make billions of people into productive earners. What\u0026rsquo;s Tesla? Ah right the collateral for Twitter - the X app everyone uses as their crypto wallet.\nThis bull case has a name as well. \u0026ldquo;The Great Rotation\u0026rdquo;. Suddenly we\u0026rsquo;re growing so fast, debt problems go away. Debt becomes an instrument for yield instead of a policy tool.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s the key litmus test. And that\u0026rsquo;s the way I understand bond market liquidity, and rates volatility.\nThe bull case and the bear case are completely different. There\u0026rsquo;s a world where central banks lose control, the US loses its reserve currency status, totalitarianism is ascendant and volatility reigns. Crashes periodically halted by money printing. Insane FX volatility. 2022 is a sneak preview. Then there\u0026rsquo;s a world where democracy and freedom prevail. Putin and Xi are studied in history books as historical aberrations in the direction of a long-term global prosperity.\nYou can make compelling arguments for both cases, and different asset classes tell different stories. Bond volatility, illiquidity and BOE pension crises foreshadow darkness. But US equities parabolic against Chinese, bolstering the dollar with higher rates, say the opposite.\nI think in a simplified sense - the happy case looks like: \u0026ldquo;2-year rates stay where they are or drop slightly, and the yield curve steepens. Stocks chop around but the Fed is allowed to do its job crushing inflation. Dollar sells off quite a bit (EUR back to 1.20) while Gold, Oil and Bitcoin also underperform.\u0026rdquo;\nThe unhappy case looks like \u0026ldquo;rates make blow out moves frequently. yield curve control implemented. Dollar moons, forcing multiple sovereign defaults. Russia annexes large parts of Ukraine. Far right European politicians align with Russia. China comes in as the new power and aligns world against US. Immigration controls implemented globally. Gold, commodities, btc parabola after the margin call is done.\u0026rdquo;\nI think we find our way to \u0026ldquo;Japan\u0026rdquo;, and associated QE-restarts, and fed pivots only in the unhappy case. So perhaps be careful what you wish for.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll end with some selections from Superfrog Saves Tokyo - one of my favorite Murakami Stories that feel pertinent to our spiritual war against the Great Worm of Global Despair.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you were. You did a great job in your dreams. That\u0026rsquo;s what made it possible for me to fight Worm to the finish. I have you to thank for my victory.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did we manage to defeat Worm? And what did I do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We gave everything we had in a fight to the bitter end.

And then\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFrog fell silent, but soon, as if dredging up his last ounce of strength, he began to speak again. \u0026ldquo;Fyodor Dostoevsky, with unparalleled tenderness, depicted those who have been forsaken by God.

I inflicted injury on him, and he on me. But to tell you the truth, Mr. Katagiri\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is it, Frog?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am, indeed, pure Frog, but at the same time I am a thing that stands for a world of un-Frog.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm, I don\u0026rsquo;t get that at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Neither do I,\u0026rdquo; Frog said, his eyes still closed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just a feeling I have. What you see with your eyes is not necessarily real. My enemy is, among other things, the me inside me. Inside me is the un-me. My brain is growing murky. The locomotive is coming.

Here I write in detail about how/ why that Colosseum will entail the creation of financial eSports\nFinancial markets are unique from politics, science, or other arenas of the media because they are accompanied by Timeseries. For the most part these timeseries consist of a price which implies a value (i.e. what you\u0026rsquo;re paying the price for) and an expectation (what that price implies - relative to historical prices, relevant comparables, consensus values and so forth). Unlike science - financial statements affect expectations about a price, and often the price of a security itself. If you state that \u0026ldquo;the earth is flat\u0026rdquo; then science can easily discard that statement. If you state, \u0026ldquo;Tesla should be worth $1 trillion\u0026rdquo; - this statement might be equally absurd, but it exists in the context of a real price that cannot easily be discarded because someone is willing to \u0026ldquo;bet money\u0026rdquo; on that condition. Put another way: financial statements affect the prices of the things they seek to describe and therefore are inherently less scientific than postulates made about the natural world. Soros and others have termed this phenomenon, simply, \u0026ldquo;reflexivity\u0026rdquo; - i.e., the innate conditions of markets to reflect not underlying reality, but rather an interpretation of a reality This disconnect between fundamentals is further exacerbated by all financial markets being (for the most part) legal abstractions. When you own a \u0026ldquo;company\u0026rdquo; you do not simply slice the company into pieces and keep one of those pieces in your closet, like you might with a bar of gold. You\u0026rsquo;re betting not only on the performance of the company but also the entire political context, and legal framework surrounding that company sending you back dividends and capital returns. Thus - in addition to being reflexive, most markets are innately political. This has become truer as governments share of GDP has expanded over the years. Legal frameworks frequently shift. Discussions and perceptions frequently shift. Shifting legal frameworks and perceptions can shift without any underlying change in the business\u0026rsquo;s immediate operations. But because a business can issue equity or debt with higher valuations, and subsequently fund new business operations - \u0026ldquo;narrative\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;regulatory\u0026rdquo; shifts are relevant fundamental information. The reason why markets seem to predict the future is precisely because markets fund the future companies plan to create. It is not some triumph of \u0026ldquo;the invisible hand\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;market efficiency\u0026rdquo; but rather very deliberate actions taken after raising money. If you say Tesla is worth $1t you give Elon Musk a war chest to go implement his plan, and give marching orders to huge numbers of people to go along with him. Thus - most \u0026ldquo;meaningful financial statements\u0026rdquo; inherent consist of a] a discussion of price and how it is arrived at b] a discussion of what value \u0026lsquo;ought to be\u0026rsquo; given prevailing market conditions c] a discussion for why price has diverged from value d] weighing implications of changing laws, regulations, and investor preferences insofar as they can affect c. Enter the problem of timeframes. It is frequently the case that the length between value and price converging is in the years. This creates a logical flaw. While certain business fundamentals of very capital-intensive, time-tested businesses (i.e. those preferred by Warren Buffett) can be reasonably discussed over years - most businesses and assets have too much fluctuation to make meaningful statements over a multi-year timeframe. This is precisely because of 7 c \u0026amp; d, or the implications of \u0026ldquo;reflexivity\u0026rdquo; taking effect. Narrative shifts and regulatory changes dominate more volatile, new ventures. In the internet era, timeframes of years are especially inappropriate - because people have an attention span of days – or weeks at most. So not only does \u0026ldquo;speaking in fundamentals\u0026rdquo; have the problem of reflexivity, but also the problem of \u0026ldquo;relevance\u0026rdquo;. People pretend to have 5-year horizons but will quickly abandon or ridicule people who have made wrong statements over a 3-month window. Whether this is wrong or right does not particularly matter - so much as it is true and predictable, and therefore a reasonable critique of financial speech. Meaningful speech ought to match the timeframe of its audience, whether that audience fully grasps (or is honest with itself about) its timeframe or not. Global tax codes and market structure (high transaction costs) providing incentives for holding for the long term and common-sense favor long term investors, but the financial media inherently stifles them. This is innate to a} narratives and regulatory shifts undeniably driving price action, and thus fundamentals of heavily traded stocks b} financial participants having small attention spans - both features unlikely to change. We are then left with a seeming paradox. Relevant speech diverges from profitability expectation. Indeed - empirical brokerage statistics show that the average audience member for financial content loses large amounts of money at worst, or at best vastly underperforms the index. Cross-sectional wide-ranging studies in multiple countries (most notably Taiwan which quantifies the financial impact of its day trading culture) show this consistently to be the case. This holds across asset classes - and is especially true in zero sum contracts such as CFDs, or forex trading. Even without studies, the vast profitability of market making enterprises focused on retail trading provide ample evidence that aggregate focus on short term financial fluctuations generates a financial loss for its participants We are left with two seeming incongruities and an obvious, and somewhat inescapable conclusion. 1] financially rational discussion would focus on very boring businesses that had limited to no effect from reflexivity or regulatory / political shifts. This would foster long term compounding gains. 2] consumption of financial media diverges vastly from said financially rational discussion. leading us to the conclusion that The primary motivation of most people consuming financial speech is not profit, but rather entertainment. This is not to say that going to the Berkshire Shareholder conference is a waste of time, or that \u0026rsquo;long term value\u0026rsquo; cannot be discussed - rather that it is like some irrelevant third party in a 2-party system driven by a mix of catalysts, and narrative shifts. The 2 major parties get all the clicks, and that is that. The impact of this is much, much higher than it would be otherwise due to the relevance of fiscal and monetary policy to financial markets. Fiscal and monetary policy is driven by human beings who conduct press releases in short term bursts which drive large moves in financial markets, often with accompanying political ramifications. This both decreases the timeframe of important market moves (i.e centers it around decisions and legislation) as well as increases the reflexive attributes of the market because politicians are human beings communicating on the very same channels as the people consuming financial content about those people. This now leaves us with a useful set of initial conditions. A] Reflexivity and narrative matter when framed in a context of value and price diverging. B] The timeframe that people can pay attention to these things is relatively short due to the constraints of the platforms / media environments we exist in - and is getting shorter and more reflexive due to societal conditions that are unlikely to change. C] People consuming financial content are doing so because they are bored or want to gamble. D] Despite this irrationality, because the people consuming content actually trade they affect the fundamentals of companies (with Tesla being the most extreme example, and Bitcoin being the second largest) This set of initial conditions can neatly account for much of the past 2 years of trading as well as discourse around trading. We are however, at a new unique juncture because the public has broadly realized that the \u0026ldquo;5 year outlook\u0026rdquo; clickbait predictions (from the common tweet format - what business would you buy and hold for the next 10 years) - largely have crashed, catastrophically. Many of the holdings of ARKK investments, various SPACs, and crypto currencies not only proved the irrelevance of \u0026ldquo;long term planning\u0026rdquo; but also destroyed huge amounts of equity capital from retail investors. Which leads to a new, emergent condition Now that the general public has widely recognized the futility of making long term predictions, they no longer approach the Puru Saxenas, the Cathie Woods, Chamaths, Michael Saylors or the Deep Value Investors (Burry for example) with the same reverence. Even if you are trading financial markets because you are bored losing 70% of your bankroll is not fun and causes a lack of engagement (which has manifested in the decline of Robinhood and Coinbase share price) The current market is characterized by huge financial losses, and a lack of trust in the trading platforms (Robinhood/ various crypto players) and the people paying for data from the trading Platforms (i.e Citadel). The market also broadly does not like Blackrock which seems intent on capitalizing on various memes in a disingenuous way (pivoting back and forth between clean energy and oil investment). After having followed markets for some time, trust in pundits such as Jim Cramer is also very low. Platforms like Coindesk (+ endless crypto grift platforms), Twitter, Substack, CNBC, Bloomberg are ad revenue supported and the platforms described above (the ones who lost peoples\u0026rsquo; money and trust) are the ones paying for ads. This both manifests directly on \u0026ldquo;feeds\u0026rdquo; of people interested in financial content as well as explicitly via paid promotion through \u0026ldquo;financial influencers\u0026rdquo;. Because creating financial content is relatively difficult - this results in a series of incentive problems. Ad sponsored financial influencers have a hard time retaining the trust of their audience, because for the most part - people paying to advertise financial products are innately not trustworthy actors. If you need to advertise your asset, chances are your asset isn’t good. Subscription supported financial influencers cannot afford to publish their best work for free - which in turn lowers their reach / audience. Finally - because financial markets are \u0026ldquo;timeseries\u0026rdquo; based - for the most part \u0026ndash; the point at which you are opining on markets is the point at which you\u0026rsquo;ve failed to generate trading profits. Institutions tend to have strict requirements about speaking at length about investment theses on social media. So there is an additional level of adverse selection based into the commentary of financial markets. If you were able to make $ trading you couldn\u0026rsquo;t even talk about your trades. Thus - we live in an era where peoples\u0026rsquo; engagement with financial markets has never been higher, but the structural information distribution systems are fundamentally broken due to a mix of timescale and incentive problems. Those who can make money trading either don’t have the time to do so, or are not allowed to do so by compliance. Those who cannot make money trading lack useful insight at best and are aligned with “retail monetization” (i.e. scams) at worst. This results in my E-Sports Postulate. The postulate states that financial markets have been gamified. There are many players who now roughly understand the rules of the game. Talented professionals have yet to meaningfully compete in a public setting that would be sufficiently intelligible or engaging for large numbers of people. A digital colosseum will emerge soon. Consider professional poker. Originally there was vast \u0026lsquo;retail\u0026rsquo; involvement on online poker via \u0026ldquo;full tilt\u0026rdquo;, resulting in large losses. But because players learned the game\u0026rsquo;s rules they appreciated the professional version of the sport which migrated to ESPN. Something similar happened with video games - where large numbers of people learned arcane rules of League of Legends by actually playing and suddenly were packing stadiums to watch people compete. I believe that something like this will occur in financial markets- simply because in spite of losing vast amounts of money people broadly can engage with markets and content around markets in a fundamentally different and deeper way than they would have been able to pre-covid. Namely, there will be \u0026ldquo;players\u0026rdquo; who iterate and trade publicly. They will have to have relatively short time horizons in order to stay engaging and will need to focus on innately engaging market topics (namely, narrative shifts and catalysts that drive large, immediate gaps in price) Short time horizon is important not just because the nature of the engaging content (which takes place in tight windows). But also because the accrual of statistical significance. It is possible to build trust around short time-horizon content because a large number of data points can accrue if you make frequent claims. Whereas being right on a long-running trend can be fun for a while, but once the trend stops - engagement cliffs alongside the asset. Becoming an eSports \u0026ldquo;player\u0026rdquo; is financially rational, potentially - because of a number of benefits that accrue to the player. Namely A] ability to collect data on one\u0026rsquo;s own statements and subsequently gain a real edge versus other people who do not have that data B] management access. It is common to receive corporate access for being a financial influencer associated with a company - which might cost millions per year to acquire as a buy-side PM/analyst. C] ability to influence Wall Street analysts evaluation of a stock / its multiple. D] the ability - alongside other \u0026ldquo;players\u0026rdquo; to fully quantify the effects of reflexivity in a way that could be deployed in scalable quantitative strategies. Fundamentally \u0026ldquo;plays\u0026rdquo; will consist of three basic actions. A] Previewing a likely market event and constructing a position / risk exposure that capitalizes on a perceived asymmetry. B] livestreaming /responding to said market event C] recapping event. Events will typically be a] fundamental – i.e earnings, central bank decisions, or data releases or b] political / narrative driven – i.e the passing of a major bill, invasion of a country etc c] unhinged – i.e purely digitally native, ala trading a bubble. But would still likely focus on an event or a perceived acceleration in a major narrative such as a conference (Consensys/ Bitcoin Miami) or an event (the merge) This is rather different from standard content in the status quo which tends to resemble traditional sell-side analysis (this is the value of a company and these are the things that could cause it to move there). 100 page PDFs and accompanying Excel Models are a bad UX that will never gain widescale traction in the attention economy. But they are the status quo for the financial industry. A better UX would incorporate: 1] relevant information around all assets being discussed 2] interactive charts previewing events and easy to read tables 3] sortable opportunity tables that inform workflows 4] streams around events 5] podcasts 6] tik tok videos with rich infographics. The UX design will likely become native to “events” – and thus will need to incorporate streaming, because events transpire in real time. This is a hard problem and will require building software More interactive UX will allow increased data collection which will increase the utility of being a “player” as opposed to running in anonymity Put another way, there will come an engagement * technology threshhold where the compliance benefits of being anonymous and running a hedge fund will be less than being a public financial esports participant. This threshold will not occur for many years, but people who are early to the trend will accrue massive advantages due to network effects latent on social media None of this exists. Without getting too in the ‘monetization’ weeds it is somewhat easy to imagine a world in which you make a “franchise model” for digitally native traders, providing them the right tools, and allowing them to share data and management access at scale – potentially even on a distributed basis, or one that benefits their streamers It is believable embedding financial alignment with these “players” could be done through a cryptocurrency or an exchange token Informational advantage also works well in this frame. Consider private 1 on 1s that are common with hedge funds and are heavily monetized by sell side investment banks. There is no reason why this format could not occur on Twitch as premium content with eSports financiers leading the sessions. Rivalries in the hedge fund world are humorous and engaging. The popularity of the show Billions shows fairly well that finance culture can translate well into the real world. These rivalries are accompanied with financial timeseries (someone is right and someone is wrong) – and this will make for good content. Cathie Wood is arguably the first Esports financier. She is interesting because she has sustained massive investment losses (in the billions) without losing her investor base. This is (I would argue) because she is able to engage directly with her holders and reassert her investment thesis. I believe Cathie’s model is interesting – but undesirable because of the problem of statistical significance (i.e. she has a hold time similar to Warren Buffett, so her theses are innately less engaging) Much as Cathie Wood invented her own ‘style’ – a fundamentally new trading/investing style needs to be deployed. Imagine a Venn Diagram. “Consistently Engaging”. And “Makes Money”. Meme stocks and SPACs are engaging but don’t make money. Warren Buffett makes money but him buying OXY once every 3 years isn’t consistently engaging. The correct format needs to both trade frequently focusing on exciting market events, and make money. All of the parameters and constraints are clear but there is an enormous psychological friction to “entering the digital colosseum”. Running an investment strategy is extremely difficult without endless online trolling or the addiction native to social media platforms. And the type of “engaging but profitable” trading strategy specifically is especially nightmarish to implement. Added to this is the need to simultaneously execute on the tech side (i.e. building something people want to consume). This is, in my view the biggest potential risk with the model. The type of digitally native portfolio managers who would perform the best in the new financial esports arena will simply burn out or go mad before the future can become a reality Reiterating point 38 - these people don\u0026rsquo;t exist. I sigh as I stretch, readying myself. I know who could do the job well though. And once you see it you can’t unsee it. Robinhood is broken. Meme stocks /crypto scams are powerful and interesting but don’t align well with users, regulatory interests, or even fun in the long run (only fun on the way up). But we cannot go back to what was before. In the ashes of the meme/retail boom of 2020-2021, will rise a Phoenix of clicks, financial assets, increasingly indistinct from the totality of speech in modern society. The crowds will delight as they see financial gladiators spilling their own livelihoods, playing the eSport of trading in a digital colosseum. And perhaps through continuous combat, something more can emerge. “What we do in life echoes in eternity” – Maximus, Gladiator Subscribe to Get These By Email Email address First name (Optional) Last name (Optional) By subscribing, you agree with Revue’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

It has not always been like this, but a glimpse of where we are today, before discussing the portal that’s opened behind my casomputer chair that I am about to step through -\nCentral bankers posting their thoughts on the daily to the derision of random armchair Austrian economists on the internet. Chairman Gensler getting ratio-ed on every post about financial regulation. Trump getting banned by a bearded hippie who is now a full time Bitcoin shill. Bloomberg reporting on Tweets days after they happened. Meme stocks. Purely mimetic assets becoming worth $100s of billions (yes, Crypto, but also HKD etc). Whether it’s crypto or CBDCs – assets are becoming increasingly indistinct from the internet and the stories therein (and thereof). The user experience of buying a Shib token or a Shiba Inu stuffed animal on Amazon is functionally the same, as is the economic output or underlying ‘culture’.\nIt’s not a bug. It’s not just a feature. I am speaking to you of the status quo. The system. The system by definition cannot be ‘weird’ because there is no alternative. We can act like reverting to historical systems is possible, but it is not because the new system emerged due to causal economic superiority which compounds by the day, has become entrenched in politics and will not revert naturally (or voluntarily, for that matter - because people benefit from these systems). Revanchist ‘retvrn’ rhetoric is fun but cannot take place in society without atrocious violence that is unlikely in a post-Patriot Act, endlessly surveilled world, bought and paid for by corporations turned into political overlords by Citizens United.\nThe system is almost ipso facto, normal as fuck. And I think it is poisoned (more on that later). We have moved in phases that brought us here. Drastically oversimplified, but— Phase 1- the traditional media worked with the establishment to both help fund the government and ensure social cohesion in war. Phase 2- the traditional media turned on the establishment ala Vietnam. Phase 3- the traditional media became fractured, and mostly became talking heads spouting off their opinions. Networks lost power to personalities. Phase 4- the talking heads left the traditional media to create their own franchises. This got super charged by social media. But these talking heads still fundamentally “existed” within the establishment (i.e. Bloomberg et al) and relied on news reporting organizations to exist.\nThis is when something weird happened - I call it Phase 5- basically, the news moved on to Social. Twitter became the better primary source versus the WSJ, or Bloomberg - because it was faster, more comprehensive, and more emotionally raw (largely as a function of effective cameras on mobile phones and faster internet connections). It also included the context of market participants. This was a user experience shift because “digital first” commentators could retweet primary sources. Because the sources didn’t exist in the real world, they existed online. And even more importantly - the sources were real people who generated natural engagement from their own personas.\nYou see it frequently even now. Financial influencers will retweet a Central Bank and get 10-20x the amount of engagement as the original post. They are amplifying and making the news because the algorithms would prefer every rate hike was announced by egirls or a jacked ex-NFL self-help guru who has mastered syncopated tweeting. And once again, forget if this is good or bad for a second - because now that it’s trending it’s more or less a mathematical inevitability that it will continue. And there’s nothing you or I can do to stop it.\nPhase 5 had become firmly entrenched by 2019. But then in 2020, during covid, we jumped the shark and moved into phase 6. A step even past the medium outpacing the message. The comments and Zeitgeist quite literally became the news. It’s now flowing in reverse. The traditional media is reporting on things that emerged entirely from the Aether and were not in response to any real-world event. Dogecoin can begin trending, infect Elon Musk’s mind, causing him to buy billions of dollars of it – which of course generates headlines. What is different from phase 6 - is that the stories stopped coming from the meatspace, and started originating from the cybersphere.\nThis isn’t some Malcolm Gladwell “aha so this is the missing puzzle piece” of some shitty bestselling insight I want to hit you with. Or a web3 startup pitch. it’s just a description of where we are - worth stating because we broadly still don’t want to recognize the phenomena as legitimate. You see it all around you - traditionalists seething, just like they have seethed at every prior transition in the media state for the last 50 years. And why wouldn’t they be upset?\nThe idea of capital markets, or the global information system being delegated to a group of anonymous weirdos has led to all kinds of bad externalities that we are not used to dealing with. The medium quite literally not only became the message, but it became the story itself. It became the Sea of Stories and the authorities aren’t happy with any such Haroun who speaks the secrets of The Story Source. As we tragically learned in recent days (praying for Salman - the Sea of Stories was probably the book that influenced who I am the most, and influences me writing this to you at this very moment)\nReflexive, self-generating stories are one thing when it comes to the news, and something else entirely when it comes to reflexive financial markets which have been prone to bubbles and feeding frenzies since time immemorial without the help of social media.\nThat’s something people outside of the e-commerce world don’t fully grock. It’s politically and culturally popular to assert that we have free will. But in aggregate, if you’ve ever run a scaled ecommerce advertising campaign - you know that free will is a rounding error. Almost definitionally, individualism cannot exist in aggregate - similar to the notion in markets that managers who comprise an index cannot collectively outperform said index. Random factors get smoothed out, and even punished as index performance in finance (or clicks / social clout in real life) becomes the end all be all. The signal is a “zeitgeist” and it manifests in specific, predictable ways that can be iteratively optimized. And the zeitgeist becomes an all-powerful Beast, in and of itself.\nPut less dramatically - latent preferences emerge randomly and evolve in an unpredictable way - but once a preference is made public and receives a large number of clicks - it’s highly likely to continue more or less indefinitely. This might have philosophical implications but once again - those are almost irrelevant, because there are vast economic engines of digital advertising and even more vast armies of people working to spin these flywheels. So here we are. All the bad human behaviors that lead to historic financial bubbles now have been placed in the hands of very-online, and often anonymous actors. There was a barrier between the dirty throngs and the sanctified halls of Wall Street before this. This barrier has occasionally been vaunted over in the past, often with disastrous implications. But the barrier has never been removed entirely.\nOur global society has reached historic wealth inequality, leaving a heavily online “leisure class” who can deploy billions of dollars of capital betting on dog coins for the clout. Or front run its users then tweet inanely about excesses of venture capital in the name of “effective altruism”.\nNone of this is self-correcting. Indeed - it is self-reinforcing. Because the wealthy keepers of the attention machine define their self-worth inside the attention machine and have the financial resources to gamble inside of it. The more benign “Patricians” can fund new toys, like Clubhouse, or Web 3 / metaverse domains. Or they can even make an outright bid for the entire town square where they can redefine the narrative around their social value. But on the darker side of the moon, the more gambling the financial social machine generates - the more profits can influence political outcomes - as we saw in the case with The Mercer family (a la Renaissance Technologies) playing a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. And I believe we will increasingly see from Ken Griffin (owner of Citadel Securities, arguably the largest beneficiary of the meme stock era) who has been going on numerous speaking events sounding very, very political.\nThe meme stock traders vilifying Griffin have it all wrong. He is their single largest advocate and will deploy near infinite sums of money to ensure the system self-reinforces, the Colosseum Stays Open, and that attention becomes ever more inextricably linked with the financial machine. As Elon Musk - likely future owner of Twitter - put it, ever so elegantly - “The most entertaining outcome is the most likely”\nThe point is - the monkey is out of the cage. And the specific monkey I am referring to has two sub monkeys. Like a stupid Simian Janus I am evoking because I am too wired to write well. 1} financial markets have become digitally native and will stay that way - ranging from A] user experience ala Robinhood B] culturally - a la crypto, WallStreetBets, or generally a culture of gambling / memeification of economic topics C] technological or format innovation - i.e. digital tokens that can serve both as assets and consumer products. Whether or not this occurs on a CBDC, or on Ethereum, or some IBM run hyperledger administered via the Libra foundation. 2} the source of news is digitally native and will stay that way. This is what I meant by us being in phase 6- where online interactions have in essence, become the news. Even interpretations of the news are more important than the news itself, and these interpretations are rendered by - essentially random- charismatic individuals.\nSo given this odd ape, and the title of this increasingly wild diatribe - this begs the question - what is Phase 7?\nI think we all know intuitively we are not in an equilibrium here. That things are moving at an increasing pace not towards order, but towards something different.\nThe reason why this equilibrium doesn’t work is because there’s a credibility problem innate to phase 6 (wherein the news is both created and broken by random entities). One of the most popular voices in crypto is Arthur Hayes, an individual who has been placed under house arrest for violating international financial laws. Three Arrows Capital was not only a popular, but a vastly well capitalized voice that also had its own money invested in its beliefs. But the beliefs were wrong, poorly risk managed, and blew up.\nA timeless heuristic since ancient times is that you can trust the wealthy because they’ll find a way to re-narrate history to fit their agenda. But that world order was predicated on a now false assumption - that the wealthy control the distribution of information. They no longer do. Archegos, Tiger Global, 3AC, Melvin and countless others falling victim to the chaos paints a clear picture that financial wherewithal can no longer serve as a meaningful hold.\nBut then, what is the alternative?\nThe alternative seems to be charisma combined with work ethic. People who choose to place themselves “out there” and become conduits for information.\nPeople who generate clicks better than others as a function of their online identity, by default, will become the gatekeepers of information for the digital era. Political information, financial insight, morality. You name it.\nNews publications simply cannot compete with the core base reality, namely that random people, mediums, and algorithms emerge which will generate a higher and thus more economic clickthrough rate than they can. Digital Darwinism. Once again - and I have a hard time with this too - it’s not about what should be. It is about what is likely, and what is reality.\nAnd yes, despite the “ economic reality”, there are severe flaws with removing credentialism from our information systems.\nThink of journalists covering a war. They’ve been trained to do so. They know how to go into war zones. They soaked up knowledge and contacts from predecessors who had operated in war zones. They have contacts within the government to ensure that what’s being said won’t put troops in danger, and in exchange get added context for their work. To imagine that random distributed individuals on the internet would be able to deliver the same quality of coverage, or have decades of required network operations is naive.\nCredentialism is a popular term in the online era because we like to imagine that we are all experts and are entitled to their mantle even if we have none of the same resources. It has become popular, for example to discredit the work of sell side financial research groups, such as those at Goldman Sachs. But things like access to institutional grade data, research, and company C suites give them a massive edge covering financial topics that cannot be easily replicated by competitors in the ‘distributed online world\u0026quot;.\n“But the sell side is just shilling IPOs”. While this is true to some extent, there have been regulatory structures and firewalls put in place that prevent completely blatant security manipulation or bad actions. It’s not perfect but it’s the result of decades of evolution. And when it goes wrong (as it frequently does such as in the case of the 1MDB scandal) - multi billion dollar fines get doled out and entire armies of compliance specialists get spun up to ensure further problems don’t arise. And these compliance / enforcement mechanisms were valuable despite being invisible. And that tells us where this is going.\nEventually people exerting their charisma to “click reality into being” in Phase 6 will lose the trust of their adherents. They’ll be forced financially to sell out to corporate overlords or succumb to greed and compromise their integrity. Weird cults will form but will be subject to dishonest cult leaders who steal their funds and exploit their members. Or they’ll start drinking their own koolaid, bet their own money and that of their adherents, and blow up their prime brokers.\nMany of the pure story tellers, the ones who mean well will be slowly ground down into shadows of their former selves by a cruel judgmental world. And the best among us, like Salman Rushdie - intent at telling the truth at any or all costs - will simply get quite literally executed in public by their tyrannical overlords.\nAnd I want to pause here to say - we have to protect these people, the true conduits of truth, the gentle souls who want to bring the light of knowledge to the world, at all costs for they are the best among us.\nAnd yet, despite these pretty words - utopianism will give way to severe cynicism. We destroyed the established order and replaced it with a shitty clickbait version of pre-industrial, pre-regulation capitalism. There is beauty, and effort and struggle to make something new. But scale invariant malfeasance, blow ups, frauds and bad actors will overwhelm it financially due to the pure incentives of the actors.\nAnd I think, you might recognize, that is where we are now. We are at the end of phase 6. The blind now understand they are being led by the blind and the evil. The visionaries are seen as delusional, or criminals. But the traditional media, and the old world. what came before… is now too dead to come back. We are playing a game though we no longer believe in its moral merit. we take solace in that we are assured of its statistical validity.\nThe financial mechanisms are too firmly in place in the new “influencer economy”, the advertisers are setting their budgets, externalities be damned.\nIt’s true in virtually every industry … okay but what the fuck is Phase 7 Phase 7 is the Digital Colosseum.\nIt’s the recognition we aren’t here for our own benefit. We are not here for Democracy, or Saving the Climate, or Securing Human Rights, or Defeating China, or whatever the flavor of the day is. We are here because a series of random digital interactions brought us here. But now we see we have become trapped. Phase 7 is looking at what we’ve built, opting into it consciously, with a willing disregard for its value, for its technical majesty, for its daily dose of dopamine. It’s seeing its critical flaw and be willing to go all the way, with every tool available. Words, financial markets, stories, pain, love, hate, technology and the absence of those things.\nIt is seeing that we have poisoned the Sea of Stories, and That This Is the Biggest Problem Of All. It’s shedding a tear at the execution of one of our generation’s great story tellers who defined so many of our childhoods.\nAs I stretch before stepping through the portal - knowing I have left you with abstraction, and not without a twinge of guilt for not having done, or shown more - I leave you with a quote from Haroun and the Sea of Stories:\n“Khattam-Shud,’ he said slowly, ‘is the Arch-Enemy of all Stories, even of language itself. He is the Prince of Silence and the Foe of Speech. And because everything ends, because dreams end, stories end, life ends, at the finish of everything we use his name. “It’s finished,” we tell one another, “it’s over.

Investors focus on the capital return potential of assets, adjusted for a discount rate. Traders focus on capturing the movement of assets. An investor may trade, to swap into a more appealing capital return or asset. But a trader would rarely invest - as that would suppose capital returns made up a higher percentage of an asset’s return profile than its movement. This is seldom the case. For example, the S\u0026amp;P 500 routinely moves more in 1 day than its annual dividend payment. The concepts that define investing are relatively well known and widely discussed. At their core, an investment analyst seeks to answer the question, “Is this an asset I would be happy to own for a long time, or until maturity?” This essentially boils down to comparing valuation relative to growth, business quality and industry/ country risk. Due to long hold periods, investors are more likely to concern themselves with the day to day affairs of the businesses they own - in the extreme case (Berkshire Hathaway), taking them private, owning them outright or operating them. I am writing this because while trading is ‘widely discussed’, it is done so in disjointed contexts unlikely to generate a return There are two types of trading. I will use the terms common in regulatory frameworks - market making, and proprietary trading. Market makers focus on providing liquidity to traders or investors and get paid the bid-offer for doing so. Most market makers have extremely low hold times - micro-seconds in the case of equities - but longer in less liquid assets such as over the counter fixed income. Like investing, market making is widely discussed. Calling it formulaic would be insulting to its practitioners. There is much art to successful execution, including procuring data that may provide an edge (payment for order flow being an example) and often impressive math involved hedging exposures in real time. The coding acumen and technical expertise to implement millions of small orders a day and reduce risk in near real time similarly merits much discussion. At its core however - a market maker aims to provide the market with the lowest spread possible, as many times as possible, without getting “run over” (which basically means trading against someone who likely has better information than you do). I am not a market maker and only described it to differentiate it from proprietary trading (what I do). I am sure my description was insufficient, or even partially inaccurate - so take it with a grain of salt. Thus - to summarize, what I will now describe is neither market making, nor investing, but rather something in between. It could be called “prop trading” but I prefer to call it short term speculating. I will simply call it “speculating” and myself a “speculator”. At its core, speculators attempt to predict asset movements, take positions before they happen and sell shortly after a set of conditions are met. Investors focus on terminal value. Market makers focus on providing liquidity. Speculators focus on taking liquidity. Because speculators frequently cross bid-ask spreads, this means a speculator must transact much less frequently than a market maker. If a speculator’s job is to predict short term asset movements, then the study of asset movements is an important part of the job. Assets move for four major reasons that are useful to a speculator. First - a repeated, price insensitive buyer such as a corporate hedger, passive index, central bank, is transacting in a particular way. I call the study of these price insensitive buyer “Flows.” Flows happen on a daily basis, but their nature depends heavily on the mechanisms of the actor. Indexes have a rebalance calendar, for example - that might determine a “flow”. Second - an asset will release important news relevant to its fundamentals. This is typically an earnings release or an investor day for a stock, or a data release for a currency. The work done to prepare for such events I term “Pre Catalyst. An asset will typically begin adjusting or moving in anticipation of a catalyst approximately 14 days before an event. Third - the gap after an event described as the catalyst, requires both an immediate fast movement and a subsequent realignment. I call the rapid response to an event and readjustment \u0026ldquo;Post Catalyst”. Assets adjust rapidly within minutes or seconds of most catalysts, but the subsequent readjustment after an event frequently takes a full 72 hours. Fourth - while flows and catalysts could exist without problem in a single economy - their existence across global markets becomes messy. Central banks and global indices fail to coordinate, or even come into conflict. A catalyst for a company in one country can drive its central bank to bail it out - which might affect a company in another country where the central bank cannot intervene legally. Because these asymmetries take a long time to rectify, they create useful trends and dislocations. This is the basis for the fourth type of trading I call “Macro”. So far I have only described fundamental trading. Everything described so far is best put as an “equilibrium condition”. In a normal economy - corporates will hedge, indices will rebalance, central banks will act in particular ways to respond to these things which will cause occasional trends and imbalances that can be “harvested” by speculators. These gentle flows will be punctuated by occasional violent readjustments triggered by catalysts. But for the most part, the violence is “expected” because it happens at pre-ordained times such as Non Farm payrolls. The term fundamental trading implies the existence of “non fundamental trading”. Non fundamental trading arises when the system described above enters ‘disequilibrium’. “Bubbles” are the most common type of non fundamental trading - and typically arise when a regulator or well capitalized entity does something extreme that creates a “free lunch” for market participants. George Soros famously posited that bubbles and ‘far from equilibrium’ situations are innate to capital markets because people A] believe markets are a natural system B] markets are not a natural system because they are comprised of the beliefs of their participants which change in response to the market itself. C] regulators cannot properly account for A and B so operate in a perpetual state of pretending their own presence is part of the natural system, when, in fact - their perennial bailouts happen because the system fails. There are two types of non fundamental trading - non fundamental macro trading – betting on the formation, and collapse of bubbles, and non fundamental flow trading – betting on stampede behavior of irrational investors (typically retail, typically using leverage). Thus there are six basic market regimes - four which happen when the market is in equilibrium (flows, pre catalyst, post catalyst, and macro) and two when the market is in disequilibrium (non fundamental flows, non fundamental macro). You will note that catalysts are absent in disequilibrium states. One useful definition of the market being in disequilibrium condition is when the variance of day to day random moves dwarves the moves when there is a catalyst for an asset. For example, before AMC was a meme stock, it had larger moves during its earnings releases. After it became a meme stock, it realized large moves for little to no reason at all. Some assets are in a perpetual state of disequilibrium by their very nature. A non controversial example might be Dogecoin - which is quite literally a joke currency with no scaling plan and no terminal value. A more controversial example would be Gold - which has monetary value due to being a perceived alternative to an existing system (that is to say, Gold is almost entirely a belief driven asset). Most assets fluctuate between states of equilibrium and disequilibrium. This concludes the description of the market which opens the way for a description of what exactly a speculator does. I believe this is composed of 8 essential parts. First - quantify flows that repeat, using data, analysis and quantitative due diligence. Map non price sensitive actors to anomalies. Create hypotheses for why flows might recur. Build systems that isolate exposure to flows, and conduct experiments out of sample to assess their repeatability. Second - preview catalysts before they happen. This boils down to identifying low expectations, low valuation, and high “carry” (i.e. capital returns) disconnected from surprising business success as measured by data, superior knowledge / context, or competitive analysis. Then structuring and placing trades with appealing risk reward (high possibility of a payout and low worst case scenario). Third - respond and trade post (after) the catalyst. This involves quantifying, in advance the likely trajectory of assets after a data or earnings release. This can be wide scale and systematic, or specific. Typically speculators will need a more nuanced view how to respond “post” catalyst if they have a large position “pre” catalyst. Fourth - combine all of the above, combined with relevant sovereign indicators (such as interest rates, currency valuation, equity performance, economic performance, central bank commentary) to identify asymmetries in global foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity markets. This is well understood and called “macro” investing. It is worth noting that flows, pre catalyst, and post catalyst trading can be performed on macro instruments such as EURUSD, but macro trading focuses more on fundamental trends likely to persist or that can be expressed asymmetrically due to the impossibility of coordinating global monetary and fiscal policy. Fifth - identify repeated price movements that exist outside fundamental flows, pre-catalyst, post catalyst and macro trading. Typically this will involve herd behavior, short squeezes, stampedes and retail trading driven nonsense. Yes, this includes internet memes. One way to think about this is that people are treating the markets like an online store. You are measuring an e-commerce checkout pattern and trading accordingly. This can be termed, detecting “non fundamental flows” Sixth - Combine 1-5 with external data, market analysis, and regulator action to identify the presence of a “free lunch” or something that is likely to get completely out of hand. Create a hypothesis about how it will get out of hand, writing in advance why and what conditions it will likely go wrong, and bet on a bubble forming. This type of trading is the highest form of speculation, and at times can risk the very existence of markets themselves when speculators stampede over governments or central banks. This is called “non fundamental macro”. It is worth noting that non fundamental macro trading requires a high degree of hubris and perhaps is not best attempted by those not strongly executing on the first 5 pillars. Seventh - Quantify the 6 potential sources of PNL. Manage risk at each strategy level. Only the macro strategy should have net market exposures in stocks, bonds, gold, oil or factors. If you do not have a quantified, and tracked view - do not have an exposure. Track performance over time and build robust systems to do so. Eighth - allocate capital to the 6 potential sources of PNL, and allocate time, resources and personnel according to expected value at risk This comprises the job of a speculator in a way that originates from the definition of speculation itself - the study of why assets move. Flows go into them day to day, when they’re not jumping about on catalysts. Sometimes bubbles come into play and all rules are thrown out the window. Parting thought ½ : I wrote this partly out of annoyance at existing classifications of speculation. Short term speculation is studying and profiting from asset movement, as discussed definitionally - crossing spreads with the intention of gain. Long/Short equities, Macro, Quant, Merger Arb, etc - are sloppy categorizations because they do not - in their very essence, come from asset movement - but rather come from asset definition - which is arbitrary. Discourse on short term speculation also drifts with annoying frequency into market making - when they are in some ways opposites (taking vs providing liquidity) Parting thought 2/2 : the idea of a “quant fund” while somewhat descriptive in the age of machine learning and “AI” is useful, but dangerous. In the framework above, Flows and Post Catalyst trading are innately more quantitative - and can even be reduced into machine learning or AI based strategies. In fact - with enough external data (imagine a full exhaust of Twitter or Google) - it might be possible to turn all of the above into “quant” strategies. But the core pillars, I’d argue - regardless of whether a human or machine implements them - come from first principles of how assets move. Also - the decision to allocate capital to something, and to turn a quant strategy on or off will likely (for better or worse) be made by a person. Or perhaps this is just the coping of an analyst who does not code well enough This comprises my understanding of speculation. If I fail in my speculation, this diatribe will be easily discarded. If I succeed perhaps it will be of interest in the future - but from this perspective is best stated in advance. Pre-catalyst, if you will. Fin.

Investors focus on the capital return potential of assets, adjusted for a discount rate. Traders focus on capturing the movement of assets.

But a trader would rarely invest - as that would suppose capital returns made up a higher percentage of an asset’s return profile than its movement.","title":"Discussion on the Study of Asset Price Movement"},{"content":"I’ve been deeply confused by fundamental investing for several years, which is – perhaps, why I tend to stick to short term trading. But given recent moves in markets, there is some reflection to be done.\nI started my journey trading in 2006, when it made a lot of sense financially. By 2011 it was clear that trading was to become a vastly less appealing career. But it was too late - I’d already invested, and had personal reasons to be in the space. Not to mention a love of markets. Nonetheless - I was economically rational. I saw the tech bubble forming and reluctantly jumped in – making sure to keep my focus on capital markets so I’d had optionality to get back into trading. I joined Palantir Technologies.\nI hadn’t thought about Palantir stock since about 2017 when I sold my shares. Until 2020, of course. When suddenly taxi drivers were telling me that it was still very early. I’d ask them what they thought of various issues, to which they’d give me a confused look and say they liked Alex Karp, or they thought the military needed to modernize. That Big Data was the next big thing and it was still very early. This was obviously humorous to me, as it almost certainly was not early. Even when I joined in 2011, people smarter than me frequently told me I was quite late to the “Big Data Bubble”.\nPalantir becoming a meme stock was a strange moment of cognitive dissonance for me, as I’d spent the past several years focusing on quantifying retail market participation. Palantir was one of the last companies I’d expect to become a meme - as it has no widely adopted consumer product, or recognizable brand. I have no opinion on the stock, nor any position. But I do have an opinion that we’re now seeing a generation of “early” investors realizing very rapidly that they’re not early at all, and that they’ve put their trust in a group of charlatans feeding them cope.\nI felt the same way about crypto. I got involved in the space relatively early (first hype cycle), and made what I thought were some good gains on the long side. It made sense to put some money in because I couldn’t trade stocks due to my other capital markets focused work. In hindsight - my gains were laughably small. Was my process wrong though? Scaling and adoption never really made sense. There weren’t any applications, and the digital gold narrative didn’t hold water. Gold doesn’t require the network to pay the miners in order to exist. If Gold miners disappeared, gold would go up. If Bitcoin miners disappeared, Bitcoin would go to zero. The vision of transaction scale was the only way to compensate miners over the long term assuming the 21m supply cap - and there were no obvious signs that would happen. Lightning / and L2 scaling have been memes for a long time but suffered from centralization and security flaws as I believe we’re about to find out the hard way with Block (FKA Square).\nHaving become sufficiently jaded, and informed - I made a decent PNL shorting Ethereum post Arthur Haye’s highly humorous “ETH is a Double Digit Shitcoin Speech” given in 2018 at a big crypto conference in SF - where it was also rumored that EOS’ treasury planned selling multiple billions of ETH at market when Bitmex launched its futures. This was on top of the fact that anyone who needed to get their money out of gold / Switzerland who was afraid of censorship via the Automatic Exchange of Information had done so by Feb 2018. So the whale bid was gone. Crypto Kitties was the primary NFT-like use case (and let us not forget to pour one out for Pepe Cash, rare digital art which also stalled out). And Dapps were too slow and inferior to their centralized counterparts to get users (sound familiar?). The 2018 crash had – in my view, very little to do with the hike cycle / balance sheet unwind (sound familiar??) – and much more to do with the lack of incremental whale buyers and failure of the technology to scale. Clogged mempools in both ETH and BTC during the first phase of the crash made people realize how fragile everything was, and it all got compounded by ICO sales all the way to the $90ish ETH lows when… lo and behold ETH perp yields went deeply negative on Bitmex (sound familiar??).\nPeople who participated in the first 2 crypto bull runs would recognize that nothing has really changed. Dapps still suck vs centralized counterparts. BTC still doesn’t scale. Lightning / and ETH2 shipping in the next 2 quarters are literally the same narratives peddled 4 years ago! What’s strange about this is the narrative of “being still very early”. While much is uncertain, and I’d say there are a number of big changes to crypto flows (namely the introduction of massive VC investment, and the onslaught of CBDC headlines combined w police state actions in previously democratic countries) - what crypto and Palantir have in common is a vast number of people telling themselves “they too can get rich”.\nIt is cope.\nThe reality is, if you’re getting into tech, artificial intelligence, crypto or big data - you are not early. I know that for sure, because I’ve been knee deep in it for 10 years. I’ve worked in the space, traded it at hedge funds, and co-founded a successful tech company. So the question is - why do people think they’re still early? Enter ARK Investments.\nThere’s a charismatic “Idea Person” who has no grasp of numbers telling what people what they want to hear. This person accumulates capital, which blows up people who do have a grasp of numbers. Typically, society tends to dislike “nerds” or people making detailed models of Tesla’s Free Cash Flow. This impulse is the origin of the “Virgin vs Chad” meme you see everywhere on Twitter, or the Midwit meme you also see everywhere. People who can’t code or understand technology want to get all the wealth that the tech bros got. And Cathie Wood tells them they can!\nThe problem is that she has taken what likely was a successful investment philosophy and track record, and hyper extrapolated it with the help of literal megalomaniacs who blew up catastrophically already (Bill Hwang). And now, unsurprisingly, is far over her skis. Just this week she blew up in what would be a literal laugh out loud portfolio at any hedge fund. Roblox, Roku, TenX Genomics, Palantir and Draftkings! Imagine having the hubris to simultaneously cover the military industrial complex, online gambling, TV and human genetic enhancement under the same “thematic bet” on human progress. Moore’s Law Charts as an investment thesis?? It’s laughable and insane. If I ran that book into earnings down 30% ytd, and then every one of those companies missed- I’d have been shown the door immediately at any credible long/short pod. I’d be locked out of the office by Monday. But that doesn’t matter. What does matter is ARK owned all of these companies in massive size, and still has a $16B+ asset base. And Cathie Wood’s investors aren’t smart enough to fire her - indeed they’ve barely reduced positions during this down move.\nPeople want to spare Cathie Wood – but the reality is that the money weighted average of her fund is near $100. At the current price of $65, it’s highly likely she’s actually negative in dollar PNL INCEPTION TO DATE.\nCathie Wood honestly seems like a great and upstanding person who isn’t trying to mislead people. But has manifested hubris. Chamath … however, is a different case entirely. He dissolved Social Capital after writing a fairly crazy investor letter calling Venture Capital a Ponzi scheme. And subsequently, he’s gone in rapid fire mode dumping on retail investors as fast as he can. He’s getting liquid. The thing is… I know for a fact Chamath is not dumb. He has hubris, but he is a survivor and is clinical/ rational in his actions. He’s dumping and accumulating cash because he thinks the entire thing is going to cave. Whereas Cathie Wood is a true believer, Chamath is a true cynic. He was early at AOL and Facebook, and knows, probably better than any living human - that we are not early.\nPutting these two things together paints a fairly clear picture of what is likely to happen next.\nPrivate venture capital firms such as Sequoia have yet to meaningfully mark down their investments to be in line with public comparables. And so far, it seems quite unlikely that this will happen. For example - I know a metaverse start up that could be a meaningful comparable for MatterPort raising a large up round. Their first round was in November. In November Matterport was trading at $32. Now it is at $7. If the start up had a similar share price, it’d be about $50. This isn’t just true in the “metaverse” - it’s true in many other areas as well - the most egregious being Chinese education. The difference between $50 and $7, is approximately the size of the gap between public and private valuations.\nI’m not the only one who knows this. Say what you will about them, but billionaire tech investors aren’t dumb, and they understand 409as.\nBecause of their extreme historical returns, venture firms raised on ridiculously good terms with big lock ups. So there is not an immediate cash squeeze coming. In fact, if anything - they appear to be shoveling money out the door at a rapid pace with the consensus being “Scared money doesn’t make money” and reputable (?) people saying that the vast majority of venture returns are made at the end of the cycle and you aren’t getting paid to time it. But zooming out - there were 4 sources of exit liquidity for venture investment. ARK Investments. Spacs. Robinhood and IPOs. Crypto token sales. Of the 4, 3 are no longer viable. Stripe cancelled its much anticipated IPO. Spacs have been gutted. ARK has rugged. Only crypto markets seem able to absorb the sheer amount of selling that needs to be done to generate a meaningful cash on cash return.\nYou might be wondering why seemingly business casual dressed dudes with normal girlfriends who eat vegan are suddenly tweeting like 3d printed weaponry anarchocapitalists. It’s because crypto markets are their only hope for exit liquidity. You’re wondering why technologists are going all in on technology that hasn’t worked for years? You’re wondering why solidity devs are $900k bid despite the fact solidity is a shit language that doesn’t have a single app with more than 1m DAUs? Look no further fam. It’s desperation. Even Cathie Wood just announced she’s investing in on-chain analysts when she probably should have been tweeting a 5-whys about bleeding out on every one of her largest longs.\nThe good news for the VCs, is that crypto fundamentals look fairly good. The ETH 2 merge seems likely to happen. Bitcoin hash power has survived China leaving the market. Ted Cruz buying Bitcoin seems like the hammer won’t be coming down in the near term, and Brainard’s speech about CBDCs seems to be referencing Tether solvency in a “risk we’ve paid attention to and won’t be an issue” kind of way. And given Biden’s popularity issues, Melania’s NFT collection, in my view, looks criminally underpriced. Realpolitik is ascendant. Russia is mining Bitcoin. DBS of Singapore, smashed earnings and announced a substantial expansion of their crypto business - setting the country to be the Switzerland of crypto. Nobody will be able to agree on anything. Chaos will prevail - a market ideal for bearer assets and portable private keys. Canada’s actions to arrest and censor its own citizens will hyper charge the crypto narrative. And the fact that Biden seems set to make a CBDC announcement will start driving fears that the central banks intend on banning physical cash. The fact they keep saying they don’t intend on banning physical cash probably should make people realize that’s exactly what’s going to happen if they’ve been paying attention at all for the last 2 years.\nThe rally in crypto, if it is to come - fundamentally, will not be about the tech. It will be about trillions of dollars of unaccounted for cash needing to find a home given a suddenly adversarial government with a sudden fetish for authoritarianism combined with better tracking technologies through CBDCs. But it doesn’t matter where the source of the rally will come from. VCs will only care about liquidity. And thanks to the heavy handed actions of nation states - the liquidity, seems to be en route.\nAt peak assets, private investors will need crypto to make up for all of the liquidity lost due to ARK, SPACs, the IPO market, and Chinternet. It will need to make up for the liquidity lost due to rate hikes and the Fed balance sheet. And just like any other liquidity seeking venture – it won’t be about fundamentals. It’s all about incentives. Raising the next fund. Dumping on retail.\nThe problem of course, is the entire thing will be completely psychotic. Nobody really will be playing Play to Earn games. People don’t actually want to use blockchain based products because they’re slow and they suck. Governance tokens assume that there’s value in active engagement w protocol decisions which is pretty dubious. And the even bigger problem is that if the fundamental move in crypto is about forced buyers – Bitcoin will consistently outperform, because it is the most liquid. Venture funds will increasingly be trading liquid tokens, and those tokens will underperform Bitcoin. Family offices will simply pile into Bitcoin instead, making a mirror image of what happened to the mutual fund industry in the US due to the rise of passive investment.\nThose are problems for tomorrow. But the confluence of the rise of authoritarianism, and a desperate need for venture exit liquidity due to a generation of “early” investors finding out they’re in fact quite late– make this a trading market for today. You’re not still early. Early is precisely the wrong term to describe a market created by what comes after the End of History. You’ll be at the mercy of insiders who are not used to liquid markets. There are no rules. There will be network attacks, and trading bearer assets through decentralized exchanges will not fit well into existing fund mandates. But that’s what is called for. For those who are prepared to buckle up, desperate counterparties at peak capital who have never traded in liquid markets make for appealing competitors.\nThe bull case is that so much capital will flow in that a post nationstate web3 + metaverse world will come to pass. But making predictions like that is above my pay grade. I’m just a Chaos marine trying to fight eternally and I suddenly sense the bravest and most honorable private investors of the Imperium here with me in the Warp.\nI’d like to end this with an observation that Peter Thiel isn’t a dumb guy. I’ve long termed Bitcoin + Palantir as “Thiel Parity”. A world where crypto is ascendant is not one where AI based citizen tracking is ascendant. And I think that’s a good framing for this week’s price action. Thiel essentially penned this idea himself in the intro to The Sovereign Individual. The Panopticon’s mirrors are cracking and I see strange beings grinning back at me – reflecting from the broken glass.\n** None of this is investment advice, solicitation for securities, and is solely market commentary.

Given absurd dovishness of Central Banks and the fact Lagarde will be speaking all weak (she is going to be dovish) - it\u0026rsquo;s going to be hard to see the rate hike narrative last in spite of extreme inflation. This is obviously an explosive combination given the fact inflation is likely to be well above the 5% target throughout much of 2022, a clear legal violation of the Fed\u0026rsquo;s mandate. But that is a problem for tomorrow. This week, should be a major pump. Further lockdowns should buouy risk assets further as Lagarde will cite down Austrian police state measures as a justification to print even more despite inflation.\nRussia going to war should be on the margin bearish for gold, as it will exhaust Russian gold reserves. It should also be quite bullish for the US Energy Sector. Parabolic rises in food prices globally also have me interested in the food sector, especially Nutrien. Can see cooperation on Monday evening between Biden and Xi to fight inflation and talk about Climate. The animal spirits sales at Single\u0026rsquo;s Day in China make China the clear and abrupt bright spot versus Europe - which given the Evergrande headline flows should be supportive of a narrative change. Also worth noting German exports surprised rather dismally last week while Chinese Exports surprised to the upside.\nThe big question on my mind right now is this \u0026ldquo;Pfizer Pill\u0026rdquo; and the extent to which the market weights it versus Austrian lockdowns. Logically a 90% reduction in death should bring Covid mortality in line with the flu. Marc Benioff essentially Tweeted that Covid was cancelled. Politicians absolutely have every incentive to pretend that the Pfizer Pill doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in order to cement further power / print more $ / do more spending bills.

This moves the Zeitgeist into one of \u0026ldquo;fiat debasement\u0026rdquo; - where, essentially large institutions believed that Central Banks have jumped the shark with their talks of \u0026ldquo;Debt as Wealth\u0026rdquo;, MMT, and so forth. With 10 year breakevens at 2%, the Fed\u0026rsquo;s target, we are increasingly at the point where the discussion becomes letting the economy run \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo;. This is in a backdrop of large increases in Food prices and analysis by things like the Chapwood Index which suggest that annual core CPI in cities is really closer to 10 or 11% per annum and has been for the past 5 years Source\nThis theme is only likely to accelerate with the possibility of a Blue Wave looking increasingly likely. Osoff is speaking charismatically in Georgia, and odds markets are now above 50%.\nAll things being equal - these moves would signal continuation of major asset moves.\nHigher oil prices as Biden removes subsidies, and a Blue Wave complicates exploration and extraction due to climate goals A lower dollar and higher 30 year interest rates as the fiscal situation deteriorates out of control. The move lower in the dollar should be augmented by the picture of the US as geopolitically unstable, with Trump dividing republicans and attempting to blackmail the Georgia governor. Lower US energy sector prices. Continued bid in sectors benefited by fiscal spending - namely clean energy, and infrastructure at the expense of big tech - due to the perception that the dems will legislate Big Tech. This is complicated by two factors; consensus positioning, and the acceleration of COVID\u0026rsquo;s new UK strain. First re: positioning. The fact European equities and the Euro traded quite poorly in the wake of the surprise China trade deal with the EU last week suggests that the buy side is over their skis long the Euro on fiscal solidarity. This probably makes less sense than one might expect \u0026ndash; because countries like Italy and Spain will be asymmetrically hurt by the lockdown, and even if they can borrow at lower rates - will be progressively less supportive of centralized decisionmaking. The realization that COVID can mutate introduces unpredictability into the efficacy of vaccines Source.\nFurthermore \u0026ndash; there are a number of perverse incentives at play to justify continuing to lock down the economy. Namely - 1) high tech weights in the S\u0026amp;P 500 and declining energy weights. Companies like Amazon tend to do well with covid news. Thus, the S\u0026amp;P and lobbyists are indifferent to new lockdowns. 2) increase of political power. Politicians are enjoying their max power at the moment, and states rarely relinquish power willingly. Thus - given incremental news flow, I think it is likely that this week - Travel names, and \u0026ldquo;cancellation of the virus\u0026rdquo; trades will radically underperform technology stocks.\nHowever - due to the Fed\u0026rsquo;s targeting of the virus / tendency to include it in policy decisions, I believe it is likely that there will be accelerated asset purchases. Rather than outright shorting stocks then, not fighting the fed would entail buying Gold, Agricultural commodities, and TIPs and short selling HY and Emerging Markets debt.\nI believe the consensus positioning in Euro shows what can likely happen to the Clean Energy sector (ICLN) even if a Blue Wave happens. I believe that Dr. Rita Baranwal\u0026rsquo;s Twitter Account is strongly foreshadowing a parabolic increase in Uranium and Nuclear energy plays Source potentially at the expense of Solar (esp with Bill Gates production experiment to blot out / dim the sun in Sweden.) Energy.gov has almost read like a stock promotion account for the nuclear sector. Given the small market caps of the names involved (Cameco at $5b vs names like RUN at $14B) - I believe this could be a triple digit move in a month.\nBiden\u0026rsquo;s hiring of a prominent Facebook attorney as a staff advisor, removes gap risk from Section 230 along with the Senate override of Trump\u0026rsquo;s veto (which highlighted 230 as an issue) was an underdiscussed story in the last week. Source Furthermore, Trump DOJ\u0026rsquo;s antagonism towards Google, and Twitter are unlikely to be reiterated by the Biden admin. On the flip side - Biden\u0026rsquo;s nomination of Kahl as national security adviser would suggest heightened geopolitical tension towards Russia Source. The New York times and other magazines are drumming up fears about Russian Cyber security. Source. This creates the argument that a basket of Cyber security names is an appropriate position to run alongside core Big Tech longs.\nIn the meanwhile, over the weekend, China made very dovish comments re: the Biden administration. It\u0026rsquo;s very clear the Media is focusing on Russia in order to provide Anthony Blinken\u0026rsquo;s extremely pro-China agenda to fly without much political scrutiny. This makes the risk reward to owning Chinese Internet due to a blue wave compelling. The potential of $2000 checks making PS5 purchases more likely also makes an interesting set up for Sony.\nNews over the weekend re: large EU grants to ASML will further provide a lift to foreign tech.\nBoiling it all down into a book:\n1 Foreign Tech Book (30% of Capital) Core thesis of this book is that ECB keeps printing, that Russia is scapegoated for global problems to the benefit of China, and that European tech stimulus finds its way into European growth stocks at the expense of Value stocks especially due to viral acceleration.\nChinternet (CQQQ) : +3% ASML (ASML Semi) : +2% Sony (SNE) : +1% Spotify (SPOT) - Spotify: +1% AstraZeneca (AZN) : +1% Yandex (YNDX) - : -2% Europe Value (EFV) : -5% EMB - EM Debt: -10% IAGG - Intl Treasuries: +5% 2 US \u0026ldquo;Green Old Deal Book\u0026rdquo; (20% of Cap) This book expresses the idea that Nuclear is the focus of the Biden admin\u0026rsquo;s clean energy focus.

Invest in a company with capable, honest and adaptive management entering an under penetrated market that invests its resources in such a way to give it optionality into new spaces. High quality sales organizations, and long term investments into customer support with expanding margins due to automation are the killer combination. categories: book summary\n1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years? If market is fully penetrated, not interesting YoY growth not needed, sometimes comes in spurts “Fortunate because they are able” – technical capability to pivot into the relevant growth area. 2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potential when the growth potential of currently attractive profit lines have been largely exploited Research should be a cluster of trees around initial seed – not unrelated ventures Company needs to be self aware re: how tapped out its markets are so that it can plan R\u0026amp;D appropriately 3. How effective are the company’s research and development efforts in relation to its size? R\u0026amp;D as percentage of sales is tricky to measure, but useful – history of producing results Management’s ability to drive diverse researchers towards a common goal is super important Feedback loop between Sales \u0026amp; R\u0026amp;D is super important Crash goals are the enemy of effective R\u0026amp;D “have to sign this deal” then drop real development work R\u0026amp;D has 3 tiers: Bad: You make something. As soon as you act, 2nd movers can act to capture all the profits Okay: You make something and someone, and the process of making it is sufficiently obscure that it’s hard to repeat Good: You make something with utility that cross applies to different domains, allowing you to be a first mover in other areas using an R\u0026amp;D moat (example: texas instruments) R\u0026amp;D efforts need to be aligned with TAM 4. Does the company have an above average sales organization? Salespeople meet with tons of customers. First party information about the quality of a sales team is a massive asset Having an in depth sales training process is important 5. Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin? You should look at margins over multiple years You want to see aggressive margin expansion correspond with revenue growth, conceptually to imply an economy of scale If somebody’s margins are depressed, they can still be good investments but: You need to make sure that “investments for growth” are actually investments in the sense they actually feasibly pay off Sometimes margins can change due to a thematic, long term shift 6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins? Be wary of peak margins where margins have increased due to ARPU increases because that eventually feeds back into demand It’s better if margins are improving due to efficiency gains 7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations? Relative labor turnover Size of waitlist of job applicants “The company that makes above average profits while paying above average wages is likely to have good labor relations” If management doesn’t care about its employees, it’s a bad sign 8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations? Confidence in President Feeling that promotions are based on ability Salary increases given without being demanded Only bring in outsiders if you have to Low friction at the top of the company 9. Does company have depth to its management? No key man risk At sales level between 15-40m USD you need to have executive process in place Management needs to have autonomy. Micromanagement is really bad “Those organizations where the top brass personally interfere and try to handle routine day to day operating matters seldom turn out to be the most attractive type of investments” Does management consider feedback from younger employees 10. How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls? “If management does not have a precise knowledge of the true cost of each product in relation to others it is under an extreme handicap” This is hard to analyze 11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition? Are there passive effects like lower cost of insurance that indicate a structural advantage in skill? For example if an insurer thinks a company is always less risky handling goods, they’re probably better handling goods Are there regulatory and patent advantages? Are there more valuable structural moats than just IP (patents run out): Manufacturing know how Sales and service organization Customer good will Knowledge of customer problems 12. Does the company have a short range or long range outlook in regard to profits? Companies oftentimes maximize short term advantage by harming supplier relationships that bite them later on Good customer support is a metric 13. In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient equity financing so that the larger number of shares then outstanding will cancel benefit from growth? You have to anticipate future raises impact on share dilution “It is well to consider that all senior converts have been converted and that all warrants, options have been exercised when calculating the real number of common shares outstanding” “If equity financing will be occurring within several years of the time of the common stock purchase and if this equity financing will leave common stockholders with only a small increases in subsequent per share earnings, run” 14. Does management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but clam up when troubles and disappointments occur? When things are going poorly it’s to be anticipated, it’s really if the management has a program, doesn’t panic and feels accountable to shareholders IF it hides bad news, run 15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity? Management enriching itself / its family members at shareholders is sheer sign of badness Issuing common stock to pay themselves absurd amounts “REGARDLESS OF HOW HIGH THE RATING MAY BE IN ALL OTHER MATTERS IF THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION OF THE LACK OF A STRONG MANAGEMENT SENSE OF TRUSTEESHIP FOR STOCKHOLDERS\u0026lt; THE INVESTOR SHOULD NEVER SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PARTICIPATING IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE” ","permalink":"https://goodalexander.github.io/posts/common-stocks-uncommon-profits/","summary":"Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits gets frequently recommended to me by top performing equity managers.
