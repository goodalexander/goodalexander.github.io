Full breakdown at a trade level here. Download\nBig tech and the virus acceleration were separated from the political narrative. I think it is notable that the basket titled “Green Old Deal” was the top performer, with big up moves in Uranium stocks throughout the week. This would be a reinforcement of the narrative that Biden will not do anything too wild re: Green energy, and will likely default to nuclear energy and hydrogen fuel providing the best risk reward given ICLN’s insane run.\nTaking book gross up to 1.75x leverage using pnl as a stop loss (also trading more bond products so lower vol book. )\nPNL Contribution Strategy Basket Virus -0.26% UK Tech -0.018% Commodity Inflation -0.001% Steepener 0.02% Cyber Security 0.10% Foreign Tech 0.30% Blue Wave 0.39% Green Old Deal 0.70% Analysis / Thought This week was a seminal week, likely in American history as well as in markets.\nA Democratic sweep sent clean energy assets soaring, and caused a large sell off in the back end of US rates. Federal reserve commentary has been increasingly nuanced - and largely points to several large trends:\nA lack of intention to extend duration of asset purchases. I.e. lack of sensitivity around long end financing costs A believe that small businesses need to be bailed out A general believe that Swap lines, munis and non traditional fed actions were justified and “worked well” Yellen, Biden and Kamala Harris have repeatedly signaled the need to help the little guy. This makes a fairly clear argument for shorting Ultra bonds and going long shorter duration mortgage backed securities, TIPs, as well as municipal bonds (which benefit from tax hikes).\nThis creates a “trend reinforcing” likely move where 1) US long duration bonds sell off 2) the dollar sells off. 3) Things the fed is buying stay up, and inflation expectations rise.\nInflation will especially be exacerbated by three concurrent trends\nExploding costs of international trade due to shipping containers Rising costs of transitioning to Paris Agreement (electrical grid re-wiring, and policy uncertainty) Biden’s insistence on workers’ rights and MMT It is likely that breakevens will run to 3 or even 4% before the Fed comments due to its language around “maximum” employment, making TIPs incredibly asymmetric especially with the Fed purchasing them.\nThus - IG credit is a preferred funding short, especially on the long end (VCLT). A steepener is no longer appropriate as front end IG credit likely doesn’t benefit from the fed’s most recent comments either.\nOne potential complication to shorting the Long End would be Joe Manchin’s objection to $2000 stimulus checks. But I believe his clarification on the subject that they should only go out to people who need them is a form of backtracking and he’s unlikely to buck Biden in his first week given that he supported Twitter’s ban of Trump vocally. Joe Biden seemed to suggest on Twitter that Trump should “not be above the law” i.e a willingness to prosecute Trump for inciting riots. This would echo AOC’s increasingly sanguine calls to censure political rivals.\nThe final thing worth mentioning appears to be a huge acceleration in US unemployment per data tracking. This has not been mentioned much, but increases the likelihood of progressively extreme fiscal actions which will turn the dollar into a dumpster fire vs EUR and CNY. Given heightened social unrest, there will be pressure to do politically popular things such as legalizing sports betting and marijuana.\nGiven that more Americans voted for Trump than Obama, despite his loss -this might seem like a “consensus building” exercise - but I believe it will backfire. Americans are installing signal en masse (glued at #1 on the app store) - likely planning for a surveillance state to be implemented. The media is highlighting likelihood of further violence. I believe this will come to pass, and the Patriot Act will be invoked to deem protestors as enemy combatants. Big Tech will likely play along, and it will be messy, ugly and unpleasant for years to come.\nI think over the next week American equity risk premiums will begin to derate in a relative space to international equities.\nI think the US Home Builder (XHB) space is especially interesting as a short. Skyrocketing Lumber prices should weigh on margins, while eviction moratoriums from the Blue Wave are likely not home owner friendly. The long end asymmetrically effects mortgage costs.\nOn the flip side, Equinix is interesting on the long side as increasing demand for Private data hosting should increase after the cartel-like action of big tech companies.\nA slew of positive data out of Europe and the backdrop of China forming internatinoal ties, along with the weak dollar as a matter of policy will likely accelerate US equity sale (in a relative space) into a crescendo.\nAt the same time stories around vaccine shortages and a perverse incentive to hoarde vaccines to curtail immigration during difficult economic times are quite negative for emerging markets broadly. Saudi Arabia and Russia are primary beneficiaries of Trump’s policies and likely are good funding shorts both on the equity side and through EMLC (credit).\nIn the backdrop - however, the Fed’s unlimited support has led animal spirits interest in trading products - with brokerages seeing triple digit year on year gains. There have not been many mentions of financial transaction taxes. Coinbase is #50 in the US app store, and animal spirits are very much en force. I believe that crypto is a “buy the dip” story and many trading oriented names like VIRT, JPM and MKTX are relatively appealing.\nThis Week’s book (download) Download Percentage Weights\n1 Gibbons - Decline \u0026 Fall (59% of Capital) The theory of this book is that US equity premiums decline massively relative to international.\nESGE Europe Index (ESGD):+5% ESG EM index (ESGE): +4% International energy (IXC): +5% Chinternet (CQQQ) : +3% ASML (ASML Semi) : +2% Sony (SNE) : +1% Spotify (SPOT) - Spotify: +1% AstraZeneca (AZN) : +1% US Low Volatility ETF (USMV): -10% Home Builders (XHB) -7% US Energy (XLE): -5% EMB - EM Debt: -10% IAGG - Intl Treasuries: +5% [ Cut trade from last week Europe Value (EFV) : -5% Yandex (YNDX) - : -2% Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infra (HASI): +2% US MREITs (REM): -2%\n]\n2 US “Green Old Deal Book” (28% of Cap) After last week’s enormous run in Lithium, the risk reward there is less appealing and adding lean to Cameco and Norilsk.

First, if international trade in intermediate goods continues to grow and global supply chains become longer and more complex, the impact of U.S. monetary policy on other countries is likely to increase as well.

We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” Source: Fed, Clarida\nBond Bearish ISM Manufacturing prices out of control: +77.6 vs 65.7 last Biden says $2k checks.

<p>Big tech and the virus acceleration were separated from the political narrative. I think it is notable that the basket titled &ldquo;Green Old Deal&rdquo; was the top performer, with big up moves in Uranium stocks throughout the week. This would be a reinforcement of the narrative that Biden will not do anything too wild re: Green energy, and will likely default to nuclear energy and hydrogen fuel providing the best risk reward given ICLN&rsquo;s insane run.</p>

<h2 id="analysis--thought">Analysis / Thought<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analysis--thought">#</a></h2>
<p>This week was a seminal week, likely in American history as well as in markets.</p>
<p>A Democratic sweep sent clean energy assets soaring, and caused a large sell off in the back end of US rates. Federal reserve commentary has been increasingly nuanced - and largely points to several large trends:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lack of intention to extend duration of asset purchases. I.e. lack of sensitivity around long end financing costs</li>
<li>A believe that small businesses need to be bailed out</li>
<li>A general believe that Swap lines, munis and non traditional fed actions were justified and &ldquo;worked well&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Yellen, Biden and Kamala Harris have repeatedly signaled the need to help the little guy. This makes a fairly clear argument for shorting Ultra bonds and going long shorter duration mortgage backed securities, TIPs, as well as municipal bonds (which benefit from tax hikes).</p>
<p>This creates a &ldquo;trend reinforcing&rdquo; likely move where 1) US long duration bonds sell off 2) the dollar sells off. 3) Things the fed is buying stay up, and inflation expectations rise.</p>
<p>Inflation will especially be exacerbated by three concurrent trends</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploding costs of international trade due to shipping containers</li>
<li>Rising costs of transitioning to Paris Agreement (electrical grid re-wiring, and policy uncertainty)</li>
<li>Biden&rsquo;s insistence on workers&rsquo; rights and MMT</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely that breakevens will run to 3 or even 4% before the Fed comments due to its language around &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; employment, making TIPs incredibly asymmetric especially with the Fed purchasing them.</p>
<p>Thus - IG credit is a preferred funding short, especially on the long end (VCLT). A steepener is no longer appropriate as front end IG credit likely doesn&rsquo;t benefit from the fed&rsquo;s most recent comments either.</p>
<p>One potential complication to shorting the Long End would be Joe Manchin&rsquo;s objection to $2000 stimulus checks. But I believe his clarification on the subject that they should only go out to people who need them is a form of backtracking and he&rsquo;s unlikely to buck Biden in his first week given that he supported Twitter&rsquo;s ban of Trump vocally. Joe Biden seemed to suggest on Twitter that Trump should &ldquo;not be above the law&rdquo; i.e a willingness to prosecute Trump for inciting riots. This would echo AOC&rsquo;s increasingly sanguine calls to censure political rivals.</p>
<p>The final thing worth mentioning appears to be a huge acceleration in US unemployment per data tracking. This has not been mentioned much, but increases the likelihood of progressively extreme fiscal actions which will turn the dollar into a dumpster fire vs EUR and CNY. Given heightened social unrest, there will be pressure to do politically popular things such as legalizing sports betting and marijuana.</p>
<p>Given that more Americans voted for Trump than Obama, despite his loss -this might seem like a &ldquo;consensus building&rdquo; exercise - but I believe it will backfire. Americans are installing signal en masse (glued at #1 on the app store) - likely planning for a surveillance state to be implemented. The media is highlighting likelihood of further violence. I believe this will come to pass, and the Patriot Act will be invoked to deem protestors as enemy combatants. Big Tech will likely play along, and it will be messy, ugly and unpleasant for years to come.</p>
<p>I think over the next week American equity risk premiums will begin to derate in a relative space to international equities.</p>
<p>I think the US Home Builder (XHB) space is especially interesting as a short. Skyrocketing Lumber prices should weigh on margins, while eviction moratoriums from the Blue Wave are likely not home owner friendly. The long end asymmetrically effects mortgage costs.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Equinix is interesting on the long side as increasing demand for Private data hosting should increase after the cartel-like action of big tech companies.</p>
<p>A slew of positive data out of Europe and the backdrop of China forming internatinoal ties, along with the weak dollar as a matter of policy will likely accelerate US equity sale (in a relative space) into a crescendo.</p>
<p>At the same time stories around vaccine shortages and a perverse incentive to hoarde vaccines to curtail immigration during difficult economic times are quite negative for emerging markets broadly. Saudi Arabia and Russia are primary beneficiaries of Trump&rsquo;s policies and likely are good funding shorts both on the equity side and through EMLC (credit).</p>
<p>In the backdrop - however, the Fed&rsquo;s unlimited support has led animal spirits interest in trading products - with brokerages seeing triple digit year on year gains. There have not been many mentions of financial transaction taxes. Coinbase is #50 in the US app store, and animal spirits are very much en force. I believe that crypto is a &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; story and many trading oriented names like VIRT, JPM and MKTX are relatively appealing.</p>

In fact, Americans that earned between $35,000 and $75,000 annually traded stocks about 90% more than the week prior to receiving their stimulus check.&rdquo; Seeking Alpha</li>

<p>Fed paper establishes a framework that Monetary Policy affects other countries, which is almost always a basis for further easing. &ldquo;The sizeable role of production linkages in transmission of U.S. monetary policy has a number of important implications. First, if international trade in intermediate goods continues to grow and global supply chains become longer and more complex, the impact of U.S. monetary policy on other countries is likely to increase as well. To the extent that this transmission channel is independent of capital flows and related policies, the results present one of the mechanisms by which capital controls may not be effective in insulating economies from foreign monetary policy actions.&rdquo; <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/01/the-international-spillover-of-us-monetary-policy-via-global-production-linkages.html">Source</a></p>

We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee&rsquo;s assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20210108a.htm">Source: Fed, Clarida</a></p>
