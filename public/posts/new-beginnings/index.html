This moves the Zeitgeist into one of “fiat debasement” - where, essentially large institutions believed that Central Banks have jumped the shark with their talks of “Debt as Wealth”, MMT, and so forth. With 10 year breakevens at 2%, the Fed’s target, we are increasingly at the point where the discussion becomes letting the economy run “hot”. This is in a backdrop of large increases in Food prices and analysis by things like the Chapwood Index which suggest that annual core CPI in cities is really closer to 10 or 11% per annum and has been for the past 5 years Source\nThis theme is only likely to accelerate with the possibility of a Blue Wave looking increasingly likely. Osoff is speaking charismatically in Georgia, and odds markets are now above 50%.\nAll things being equal - these moves would signal continuation of major asset moves.\nHigher oil prices as Biden removes subsidies, and a Blue Wave complicates exploration and extraction due to climate goals A lower dollar and higher 30 year interest rates as the fiscal situation deteriorates out of control. The move lower in the dollar should be augmented by the picture of the US as geopolitically unstable, with Trump dividing republicans and attempting to blackmail the Georgia governor. Lower US energy sector prices. Continued bid in sectors benefited by fiscal spending - namely clean energy, and infrastructure at the expense of big tech - due to the perception that the dems will legislate Big Tech. This is complicated by two factors; consensus positioning, and the acceleration of COVID’s new UK strain. First re: positioning. The fact European equities and the Euro traded quite poorly in the wake of the surprise China trade deal with the EU last week suggests that the buy side is over their skis long the Euro on fiscal solidarity. This probably makes less sense than one might expect – because countries like Italy and Spain will be asymmetrically hurt by the lockdown, and even if they can borrow at lower rates - will be progressively less supportive of centralized decisionmaking. The realization that COVID can mutate introduces unpredictability into the efficacy of vaccines Source.\nFurthermore – there are a number of perverse incentives at play to justify continuing to lock down the economy. Namely - 1) high tech weights in the S\u0026P 500 and declining energy weights. Companies like Amazon tend to do well with covid news. Thus, the S\u0026P and lobbyists are indifferent to new lockdowns. 2) increase of political power. Politicians are enjoying their max power at the moment, and states rarely relinquish power willingly. Thus - given incremental news flow, I think it is likely that this week - Travel names, and “cancellation of the virus” trades will radically underperform technology stocks.\nHowever - due to the Fed’s targeting of the virus / tendency to include it in policy decisions, I believe it is likely that there will be accelerated asset purchases. Rather than outright shorting stocks then, not fighting the fed would entail buying Gold, Agricultural commodities, and TIPs and short selling HY and Emerging Markets debt.\nI believe the consensus positioning in Euro shows what can likely happen to the Clean Energy sector (ICLN) even if a Blue Wave happens. I believe that Dr. Rita Baranwal’s Twitter Account is strongly foreshadowing a parabolic increase in Uranium and Nuclear energy plays Source potentially at the expense of Solar (esp with Bill Gates production experiment to blot out / dim the sun in Sweden.) Energy.gov has almost read like a stock promotion account for the nuclear sector. Given the small market caps of the names involved (Cameco at $5b vs names like RUN at $14B) - I believe this could be a triple digit move in a month.\nBiden’s hiring of a prominent Facebook attorney as a staff advisor, removes gap risk from Section 230 along with the Senate override of Trump’s veto (which highlighted 230 as an issue) was an underdiscussed story in the last week. Source Furthermore, Trump DOJ’s antagonism towards Google, and Twitter are unlikely to be reiterated by the Biden admin. On the flip side - Biden’s nomination of Kahl as national security adviser would suggest heightened geopolitical tension towards Russia Source. The New York times and other magazines are drumming up fears about Russian Cyber security. Source. This creates the argument that a basket of Cyber security names is an appropriate position to run alongside core Big Tech longs.\nIn the meanwhile, over the weekend, China made very dovish comments re: the Biden administration. It’s very clear the Media is focusing on Russia in order to provide Anthony Blinken’s extremely pro-China agenda to fly without much political scrutiny. This makes the risk reward to owning Chinese Internet due to a blue wave compelling. The potential of $2000 checks making PS5 purchases more likely also makes an interesting set up for Sony.\nNews over the weekend re: large EU grants to ASML will further provide a lift to foreign tech.\nBoiling it all down into a book:\n1 Foreign Tech Book (30% of Capital) Core thesis of this book is that ECB keeps printing, that Russia is scapegoated for global problems to the benefit of China, and that European tech stimulus finds its way into European growth stocks at the expense of Value stocks especially due to viral acceleration.\nChinternet (CQQQ) : +3% ASML (ASML Semi) : +2% Sony (SNE) : +1% Spotify (SPOT) - Spotify: +1% AstraZeneca (AZN) : +1% Yandex (YNDX) - : -2% Europe Value (EFV) : -5% EMB - EM Debt: -10% IAGG - Intl Treasuries: +5% 2 US “Green Old Deal Book” (20% of Cap) This book expresses the idea that Nuclear is the focus of the Biden admin’s clean energy focus. Similarly, Nuclear powering hydrogen production is a big narrative from the DOE. Russia and Emerging markets focused on travel and energy are funding shorts, as it’s likely a virus mutation weakens the Astra Zeneca story (constant MRNA updates needed etc).\nNextera (NEE): +1.5% Cameco (CCJ): +1.5% Linde (LIN): +1% Ormat (ORA): .5% Ballard Power (BLDP): .5% NRG (NRG): +1% BHP Billiton (BHP): +1% Vale (VALE): +1% Lithium ETF (LIT): +1% Chile (CHL): +1% Russia (RSX): -5% Saudi (KSA): -3% Thailand (THD): -2% 3 Blue Wave Laggards (11% of Cap) With ICLN pricing in massive likelihood of a blue wave, as are many assets, International energy and sustainable infra vs MReits are appealing risk reward as Biden follows through with threats to curtail energy production and a Democratic senate can put into place eviction bans which could lower housing prices and hurt MReits.\nBritish Petroleum (BP): .5% Equinor (EQNR): .5% International Energy (IXC): 3% Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infra (HASI): +2% US Energy (XLE): -3% US MREITs (REM): -2% 4 Virus Acceleration (22% of Capital) The basic bet here is that Biden is a lot more friendly to big Tech than the market realizes, and that will begin to price in this week as people think deeply about Blue Wave gap moves. Facebook banning voter ads from Republicans in Georgia… here we go\nFacebook (FB): +1.5%\nGoogle (GOOG): +1%\nAmazon (AMZN): +1%\nActivision (ATVI): +.5%\nSquare (SQ): +.5%\nComcast (CMCSA): +.5%\nZoom (ZM): +.5%\nRegional Banks (KRE): -2.5%\nHigh Yield Debt (HYG): -8%\nTIPs (TIP): +6%\n5 Commodity Inflation (8% of Capital) I like the story of Vietnam increasingly being a destination for low cost inputs / manufacturing, which is a story played out in Last Week’s data. Should benefit from declining energy costs as well without being hit too badly from a covid accel. Low volatility Emerging Markets, mostly mega caps, I think underperform as people looking to play offense on the USD and energy weights hold it down.\nDBA (Agriculture): +1.5% Vietnam (VNM): +2.5% EM Low Volatility (EEMV): -4% 6 UK Tech Narrative (4% of Capital) Ultimately, think the UK is really picking up steam as an international tech hub and as the USD weakness story decelerates I think GBPUSD trades higher.\nLong GBPUSD (FXB): +4% 7 IG Corporate Steepener (16% of Capital) I think the Fed’s ability to absorb the front end of the curve is far higher in the near term absent Yellen coming out and making a policy statement about duration. This moves the narrative out to the defecit and being anti-corporate. The 50 bps of yield pick up you get for underwriting an obscene amount of policy risk with breakevens north of 2% feels unreasonable\nLong USIG +10% Short VCLT -6% 8 Cyber Security (6% of Capital) Biden said there was going to be a massive investment and I believe we should take him at face value. At the same time the regulatory environment for Telco, net neutrality etc makes cable players likely a short\nLong BUG +3% Short VZ -1.5% Short CHTR -1.5% MACRO TAKES AND HEADLINES US Bullish: Mania. “U.S. companies sold $368 billion in new stock last year, 54% more than the prior high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.” Source Foundries are at capacity due to Semiconductor growth implying a strong tech sector Source: Trendforce Tesla modestly beats delivery estimates (500k vehicles) Source : PR Redbook 8.9% year on year vs 6.5% last Chicago PMI surprises to the upside and US continuing \u0026 initial claims are below consensus Fauci reasserting positivity on Vaccine Roll out. ““We have an agreement with CVS and Walgreens, and we are starting to ship vaccines to those locations as allocated by the states – that is really the key point.” Source: BBG US Bearish: AOC engages in political blacklisting of rivals after previously calling to make persecution lists.

Non profits similarly disastrous “In fiscal year 2020, state revenue declined 1% for the first time since the Great Recession, and states expect greater revenue declines ahead.

  <div class="post-content"><p>Here I detail some analysis of newsflow over the last week and where I see best risk reward going into the start of the year</p>
<h2 id="analysis--thought">Analysis / Thought<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analysis--thought">#</a></h2>
<p>The core theme coming out of the gate of the New Year is a parabolic move higher in Bitcoin on the backdrop of VanEck getting a Bitcoin ETF. This moves the Zeitgeist into one of &ldquo;fiat debasement&rdquo; - where, essentially large institutions believed that Central Banks have jumped the shark with their talks of &ldquo;Debt as Wealth&rdquo;, MMT, and so forth. With 10 year breakevens at 2%, the Fed&rsquo;s target, we are increasingly at the point where the discussion becomes letting the economy run &ldquo;hot&rdquo;. This is in a backdrop of large increases in Food prices and analysis by things like the Chapwood Index which suggest that annual core CPI in cities is really closer to 10 or 11% per annum and has been for the past 5 years <a href="https://twitter.com/tanayj/status/1345080274107785216">Source</a></p>
<p>This theme is only likely to accelerate with the possibility of a Blue Wave looking increasingly likely. Osoff is speaking charismatically in Georgia, and odds markets are now above 50%.</p>
<p>All things being equal - these moves would signal continuation of major asset moves.</p>
<ol>
<li>Higher oil prices as Biden removes subsidies, and a Blue Wave complicates exploration and extraction due to climate goals</li>
<li>A lower dollar and higher 30 year interest rates as the fiscal situation deteriorates out of control. The move lower in the dollar should be augmented by the picture of the US as geopolitically unstable, with Trump dividing republicans and attempting to blackmail the Georgia governor.</li>
<li>Lower US energy sector prices.</li>
<li>Continued bid in sectors benefited by fiscal spending - namely clean energy, and infrastructure at the expense of big tech - due to the perception that the dems will legislate Big Tech.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is complicated by two factors; consensus positioning, and the acceleration of COVID&rsquo;s new UK strain. First re: positioning. The fact European equities and the Euro traded quite poorly in the wake of the surprise China trade deal with the EU last week suggests that the buy side is over their skis long the Euro on fiscal solidarity. This probably makes less sense than one might expect &ndash; because countries like Italy and Spain will be asymmetrically hurt by the lockdown, and even if they can borrow at lower rates - will be progressively less supportive of centralized decisionmaking. The realization that COVID can mutate introduces unpredictability into the efficacy of vaccines <a href="https://twitter.com/Williams_T_C/status/1345708240382918658">Source</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore &ndash; there are a number of perverse incentives at play to justify continuing to lock down the economy. Namely - 1) high tech weights in the S&amp;P 500 and declining energy weights. Companies like Amazon tend to do well with covid news. Thus, the S&amp;P and lobbyists are indifferent to new lockdowns. 2) increase of political power. Politicians are enjoying their max power at the moment, and states rarely relinquish power willingly. Thus - given incremental news flow, I think it is likely that this week - Travel names, and &ldquo;cancellation of the virus&rdquo; trades will radically underperform technology stocks.</p>
<p>However - due to the Fed&rsquo;s targeting of the virus / tendency to include it in policy decisions, I believe it is likely that there will be accelerated asset purchases. Rather than outright shorting stocks then, not fighting the fed would entail buying Gold, Agricultural commodities, and TIPs and short selling HY and Emerging Markets debt.</p>
<p>I believe the consensus positioning in Euro shows what can likely happen to the Clean Energy sector (ICLN) even if a Blue Wave happens. I believe that Dr. Rita Baranwal&rsquo;s Twitter Account is strongly foreshadowing a parabolic increase in Uranium and Nuclear energy plays <a href="https://twitter.com/DOE_NE1/status/1345771334362652678">Source</a> potentially at the expense of Solar (esp with Bill Gates production experiment to blot out / dim the sun in Sweden.) Energy.gov has almost read like a stock promotion account for the nuclear sector. Given the small market caps of the names involved (Cameco at $5b vs names like RUN at $14B) - I believe this could be  a triple digit move in a month.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s hiring of a prominent Facebook attorney as a staff advisor, removes gap risk from Section 230 along with the Senate override of Trump&rsquo;s veto (which highlighted 230 as an issue) was an underdiscussed story in the last week. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22206646/joe-biden-jessica-hertz-facebook-staff-secretary-big-tech">Source</a> Furthermore, Trump DOJ&rsquo;s antagonism towards Google, and Twitter are unlikely to be reiterated by the Biden admin. On the flip side - Biden&rsquo;s nomination of Kahl as national security adviser would suggest heightened geopolitical tension towards Russia <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-pick-colin-kahl-steele-dossier-trump-russia-collusion">Source</a>. The New York times and other magazines are drumming up fears about Russian Cyber security. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">Source</a>. This creates the argument that a basket of Cyber security names is an appropriate position to run alongside core Big Tech longs.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, over the weekend, China made very dovish comments re: the Biden administration. It&rsquo;s very clear the Media is focusing on Russia in order to provide Anthony Blinken&rsquo;s extremely pro-China agenda to fly without much political scrutiny. This makes the risk reward to owning Chinese Internet due to a blue wave compelling. The potential of $2000 checks making PS5 purchases more likely also makes an interesting set up for Sony.</p>
<p>News over the weekend re: large EU grants to ASML will further provide a lift to foreign tech.</p>
<p>Boiling it all down into a book:</p>

<p>This book expresses the idea that Nuclear is the focus of the Biden admin&rsquo;s clean energy focus. Similarly, Nuclear powering hydrogen production is a big narrative from the DOE. Russia and Emerging markets focused on travel and energy are funding shorts, as it&rsquo;s likely a virus mutation weakens the Astra Zeneca story (constant MRNA updates needed etc).</p>

<p>With ICLN pricing in massive likelihood of a blue wave, as are many assets, International energy and sustainable infra vs MReits are appealing risk reward as Biden follows through with threats to curtail energy production and a Democratic senate can put into place eviction bans which could lower housing prices and hurt MReits.</p>

<p>I like the story of Vietnam increasingly being a destination for low cost inputs / manufacturing, which is a story played out in Last Week&rsquo;s data. Should benefit from declining energy costs as well without being hit <em>too</em> badly from a covid accel. Low volatility Emerging Markets, mostly mega caps, I think underperform as people looking to play offense on the USD and energy weights hold it down.</p>

<p>I think the Fed&rsquo;s ability to absorb the front end of the curve is far higher in the near term absent Yellen coming out and making a policy statement about duration. This moves the narrative out to the defecit and being anti-corporate. The 50 bps of yield pick up you get for underwriting an obscene amount of policy risk with breakevens north of 2% feels unreasonable</p>
