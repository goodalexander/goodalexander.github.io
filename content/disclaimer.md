Alex Good - an Individual Investor based in Puerto Rico - operates a Twitter account at www.twitter.com/goodalexander (“Twitter Account”). Please read this legal disclaimer in full prior to reading any Content. Content refers to any and all statements on my Twitter Account, other social accounts, this website or any fascimile thereof. 

Nothing in the Content may be considered as an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell products or services. The purpose of my Twitter Account is solely to share and discuss investment and trading ideas.

Use of Alex Good's research is at your own risk. To the best of my ability and belief, all information contained in my Twitter Account is accurate, reliable and reflective of my personal investment process. However, all information contained on my Content is provided “as is” and I expressly disclaim making any express or implied warranties with respect to the accuracy or suitability of the information contained therein for any particular usage. In no event shall I be held responsible or liable for the correctness of any such material or for any damage or lost opportunities resulting from its usage. 

Prior to making any investment or hiring any investment manager you should consult with professional financial, legal and tax advisors to assist in due diligence as may be appropriate and determining the appropriateness of the risk associated with a particular investment.

Furthermore, the investments represented on this Content are speculative in nature - representing positions in cryptocurrencies and equity options both of which have a history of causing investors complete loss of capital. Thus, there is not reasonable expectation of profit from consuming information on the GoodAlexander Twitter page. Trades on this Twitter page are likely not suitable for investors seeking preservation of capital, income, or low volatility gains. I assume no liability for mismatch between Tweets on this page and investor expectations. 

You should assume that as of the publication date of any tweet, post or communication referencing any publicly traded security, Alex Good, his associates or associated entities may have a position in the stock covered herein, and therefore stands to realize significant gains in the event that the price of stock moves. Following publication of any Tweet, I intend to continue transacting in the securities covered therein, and I may be long, short or neutral at any time thereafter regardless of my initial position or recommendation.

You should assume that I trade before I tweet - for both entries and exits of trades and that anyone conducting the same transactions after I do is likely to realize worse performance due to the likely price movement caused by my trading. 

You should assume that all data about the Tweets including likes, views and retweets are being analyzed to further aid my investment process. This is not limited to the use of cookies and redirect links (such as URL shorteners) on external articles. By consuming the information on this feed you agree that your information can be used to inform my investment decisions. By January of 2024, attempts will be made to quantify the impacts of this data on trading profitability to better inform users about its effects. Investors who do not consent to the usage of their Twitter data as part of an investment process should immediately cease consuming this information.

A brief overview of Alex Good's trading is as follows.

Alex Good runs two portfolios. First - a Flagship Portfolio which contains longer term, discretionary ideas. The Flagship Portfolio primarily focuses on long hold time trade ideas primarily in volatile stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. Second, a Tactical Portfolio which uses quantitative signals to harvest market alpha, primarily trading equities and cryptocurrencies intraday. Tweets in the GoodAlexander account accurately reflect the holdings of the Flagship Portfolio but do not reflect the Tactical Portfolio. 

Internal processes have been put in place to ensure the Tactical Portfolio does not trade ahead of the Flagship Portfolio or take positions counter to its recommendations. This being said, it is fair to assume that the positions represented on this Twitter account do not represent a full % of my net investment portfolio. When % positions are alluded to and trade sizes disclosed, these statistics are only pertinent to the Flagship Portfolio.

Users of the Content (“Users”) shall not use the Content at any time for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited and shall comply with any applicable local, state, national or international laws or regulations when using or consuming the Content.
