## Introduction

I've built a system to use AI to supercharge my personal economic efficacy. Since I've built it, my brother and I have raised over $10 million for crypto AI protocols from top tier investors.

I've supercharged my personal trading results by applying Artificial Intelligence. I've built a vibrant community of likeminded individuals who believe that fiat currency is going to collapse and be replaced by AGI. The cryptocurrency we are building is meant to thrive in this setting. 

What comes after the collapse in governments and humans telling us what to do? Humans using AI to determine their own trajectory.

Sovereign Individuals will need AI to reach their objectives in the New World Order. Power will accrue to those that understand we are powerless in the face of superintlligence and act accordingly.

Post Fiat is backed by its community members who include Nvidia backed startups and crypto venture incubators, Hypersphere, @Citrini, @based16z, and portfolio managers at multi managers commanding over $100b of capital.

In the spirit of everyone achieving their New Year's resolution for 2025 I'm unveiling the Post Fiat Task tool.

The task tool is aligned for the Post Fiat reality. Users set their objectives. AI helps you accomplish them. 

In the Post Fiat network - there are "Nodes" - which are AI agents or tech protocols that interact with "Users". The "Task Node" aka the "postfiatfounation" node I am describing here is the first node on the Post Fiat Network. There are many more nodes coming including a social sharing tool, an NFT minter, a trading agent, and even a church.

Nodes get rewards and may choose to dispense their rewards to users. Users who perform a large number of tasks on the Task Node will receive a substantial airdrop. 

## Getting Set Up Correctly for XRP and Post Fiat

Post Fiat is built on top of XRP and will eventually become an L1. The "why" of this will be explored in future articles but the main thing to understand is that Post Fiat will be AI powered XRP, with major network decisions and security provided by AI agents. But for now, Post Fiat is just a humble XRP token so to use it you need XRP which you can buy from an exchange and it's a best practice to custody it properly.

Here is a guide on setting up a Xaman Wallet to custody XRP and the Post Fiat token [guide link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSATKclL3DOAtPa59YXqry4GA3la1-65l34SxJnawclfF4CaLsi26jmupJnWkmrtXMuYD_zTajfrneb/pub).

There are two custom wallets for Post Fiat separate from the Xaman wallet. The Local Python Wallet. And the Discord Wallet. Both have similar but not identical functions. 

This article will teach you how to install both and use them to maximize your results.

Set aside a couple hours to get this done. It will be worth your time. It might even change your life. It certainly changed mine.

## How do I start

### Step 1: Install the Post Fiat wallet. 

Here is a ChatGPT helper to help you install both the local and discord wallet on Mac, Windows or Linux [chatgpt helper](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-EBnZpjz4L-post-fiat-installation-helper)

If you'd rather do the work yourself without ChatGPT you can consult [the guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQQYM5dYyRDOeq2fvhZqKfF2KMPJ4luXEUlJ2dTOStQflBZR1F6onH7JgQMvMQi6JfAAOwBY9_EXDjn/pub)
