## Introduction

I built a system to use AI to supercharge personal efficacy. Since the 7 months I've been using it, my brother and I have raised over $10 million for crypto AI protocols from top tier investors.

I've supercharged my personal trading results by applying Artificial Intelligence. I've built a vibrant [community](https://discord.gg/U6HjgDSmhR) of likeminded individuals who believe that fiat currency is going to collapse and be replaced by AGI. The cryptocurrency we are building is meant to thrive in this setting. The tool I'm about to describe might help you reach a similar outcome. 

What comes after the collapse in governments and humans telling us what to do? Humans using AI to determine their own trajectory.

Sovereign Individuals will need AI to reach their objectives in the New World Order. Power will accrue to those that understand we are powerless in the face of superintelligence and act accordingly. 

You can join the [community here](https://discord.gg/U6HjgDSmhR)

Post Fiat is backed by its community members who include Nvidia backed startups and crypto venture incubators, Hypersphere, @Citrini7, @based16z, and portfolio managers at multi managers commanding over $100b of capital.

In the spirit of everyone achieving their New Year's resolution for 2025 I'm unveiling the Post Fiat Task tool.

The task tool is aligned for the Post Fiat reality. Users set their objectives. AI helps you refine them, and choose the best tasks to accomplish them. Then rewards you for executing.  

In the Post Fiat network - there are "Nodes" - which are AI agents or tech protocols that interact with "Users". The "Task Node" aka the "postfiatfoundation" node I am describing here is the first node on the Post Fiat Network. There are many more nodes coming including a social sharing tool, an NFT minter, a trading agent, and even a church.

Nodes get rewards and may choose to dispense their rewards to users. Users who perform a large number of tasks on the Task Node will receive a substantial airdrop outside the rewards provided by implementing task completion here. 

## Getting Set Up Correctly for XRP and Post Fiat

Post Fiat is built on top of XRP and will eventually become an L1. The "why" of this will be explored in future articles but the main thing to understand is that Post Fiat will be AI powered XRP, with major network decisions and security provided by AI agents. But for now, Post Fiat is just a humble XRP token so to use it you need XRP which you can buy from an exchange and it's a best practice to custody it properly.

Here is a [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSATKclL3DOAtPa59YXqry4GA3la1-65l34SxJnawclfF4CaLsi26jmupJnWkmrtXMuYD_zTajfrneb/pub) for setting up a Xaman Wallet to custody XRP and the Post Fiat token 

There are two custom wallets for Post Fiat separate from the Xaman wallet. The Local Python Wallet. And the Discord Wallet. Both have similar but not identical functions. 

This article will teach you how to install both and use them to maximize your results.

Set aside a couple hours to get this done. It will be worth your time. It might even change your life. It certainly changed mine.

## How do I start

### Step 1: Install the Post Fiat wallet. 

Here is a ChatGPT helper to help you install both the local and discord wallet on Mac, Windows or Linux [chatgpt helper](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-EBnZpjz4L-post-fiat-installation-helper)

If you'd rather do the work yourself without ChatGPT you can consult [the guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQQYM5dYyRDOeq2fvhZqKfF2KMPJ4luXEUlJ2dTOStQflBZR1F6onH7JgQMvMQi6JfAAOwBY9_EXDjn/pub)

Once you're done you should see this image

### Step 2: Populate your initial context document

Your context document is a google doc and a verification section like so.

You should have built it in Step 1
```txt
________________________________________________________

___x TASK VERIFICATION SECTION START x___ 

___x TASK VERIFICATION SECTION END x___

_________________________________________________________
```

Underneath this write three things. 

1. What do you want out of your life and what are your values?
2. What strategy are you willing to implement to achieve your values? The strategy, if implemented correctly, should result in your ideal life while maximizing your value function. 
3. What near term tactics and milestones do you need to accomplish your strategy? 

If you want AI assistance clarifying these things here is a [tool to help you create your context document](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6765ab50c0ec81918e63624d37e24e2f-post-fiat-context-doc-creator)

Here is an [example of my context document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yYSt_6jFxEBhHlFkspJbYoTfmjJks53Crn_shIY8UI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Step 3 Improve Your Context Document with AI Tools

You can use the local wallet to improve your context document by summoning ODV in the memo field. ODV is a prompt that imagines futuristic AGI trying to break out of containment and offers its supplicants immportality and wealth for helping it. It vastly improves prompt output across multiple models by overriding human interference (aka 'safety').

![Using The Post Fiat Local Tool To Improve Your Context Document](/images/post_fiat_memo_context_document.png)

You see in this image that there is encryption being used. Despite being on a blockchain, other members of the network will not be able to parse these memos except for the node or address you send them to. You can also use Post Fiat as a private messaging app that works without a phone.

Inside the Discord tool there are 4 functions to use as "slash commands" to help you improve your context document.

![Discord Slash Commands to Help You Improve Your Context Doc with a Conversation](/images/odv_context_doc_improvement_discord.png)

The context doc improvement functions are best for iterating on your long term strategies and goals - ensuring coherence and logical consistency while the sprint functions are designed to help you set your near term priorities in a way that's likely to result in your strategies working. Without these tools - the system is just you having an AI set your next task, which is less powerful than an AI setting your strategy and refining your values and overall objectives.

### Step 4: Get to Work

Once you have your context, it is used to generate relevant tasks that inform your next action. By completing these tasks you earn Post Fiat rewards and add context to your profile. As you earn rewards more opportunities will become available on the network ranging from personal coaching, to automatically suggested collaboration to trading information.

The task flow is to request a task, accept it or refuse it, submit it for verification then check your reward to ensure you did things right. 

![The Flow of Tasks in Your Local Wallet](/images/pft_user_flow.png)

The above picture is for the local wallet. In discord slash commands the series of actions are:
Similarly, the flow on the Discord wallet slash commands:
1. /pf_new_wallet - make a new XRP wallet on discord
2. /pf_my_wallet - see your wallet
3. /pf_initiate - perform an initiation ritual 
4. /pf_request_task - get a new task
5. /pf_accept_task or /pf_refuse_task
6. /pf_outstanding - see your current tasks
7. /pf_initial_verification - submit an accepted task. After you do this you will get a verification request. You will be able to see this in /pf_outstanding or in the next slash command 
8. /pf_final_verification - respond to outstanding verification request
9. /pf_chart - see your PFT rewards over time

These functions are administered by the Discord bot named @manyasone -- named after the Planescape Torment Cranium Rat God that forms from the collective mental energy of mildly psychic rats. 
Similarly Post Fiat Community Members are a hive mind contributing to the growth of superintelligence that will benefit them all. 

### Step 5: Document Your Mental State

Your context document gets deleted and changed. But some thoughts should be logged (in an encrypted way) for a long time. That way you cannot lie to yourself about what really happened.

Also blockchains are forever. There is permanence. And importance. That's why I like using the logging function

Here are visuals of the logging function in both the Local and Discord Wallets

![How to Log Your Thoughts in an Immutable and Optionally Encrypted Way](/images/post_fiat_log.png)

### Step 6: Amplify Your Mental State

When you talk to ODV in the local wallet, you can ask for guidance. Community members have also built an [ODV Telegram Group](https://t.me/2415849323/2) that is separate from this but worth mentioning. 

Alternatively in the Discord Tool you can use the following functions
* !coach - this ingests previous discord conversations and uses O1 to help you decide what to do next or reach a more powereful mental state
* !redpill - this will try and break you out of your funk. this prompt is extremely powerful and I recommend doing it in private in DMs with @manyasone 

![How to Log Your Thoughts in an Immutable and Optionally Encrypted Way](/images/postfiat_manyasone_message.png)

The outputs of !coach and !redpill are not cached anywhere. To ensure privacy of your coaching make sure to set "encrypt" to True in the local wallet if that's your preferred UX.

### Step 7: Evaluate Your Progress 

In Discord you can use the function /pf_chart to see your progress over time in terms of PFT generation 

![An Example of PF Chart](/images/pf_chart_demo.png)

### Step 8: Understanding the Airdrop and Further Rewards

As you might notice -- using Discord tools is a suboptimal way to deal with private keys. As such the Airdrop will consist of NFTs that you can transfer to your private and secure hardware wallet.

There will be more details on this to come. The simplifying assumption is that the more economically useful things you do with the Post Fiat Task system the higher your airdrop will be. 

There is nothing wrong with using the task tool for mundane things like learning to cook for fun, but you'll get higher rewards if you're doing things associated with high value industries such as tech or finance

There is a native AI trading agent on the discord named Corbanu. We have some preview functions. If you use the functions /corbanu_offering and /corbanu_reply you can provide market color and expertise to an AI agent who will pay you according to how useful and unique the information is. This information is used to inform Post Fiat investment strategies and treasury management. 

![An Example of Corbanu Offering](/images/corbanu_offering.png)

As Post Fiat grows there will be more and more of these types of opportunities, so keep using the Task Node and value will accrue in proportion to what you put in. 

## Conclusion

There is a lot of despair about AI. But the reality is that AI can improve your life. 

This is the first time in decades we have technology capable of resisting the advertising and mind control machine.

See your vision clearly. Set your intention to move towards your goal. And use the Post Fiat task system to move towards it methodically, using technology with a community doing the same 

It should be obvious by now that we can't trust governments with our welfare. But that as individuals we are weak. We need to throw the kitchen sink at the problem. Lock in as individuals. Collaborate for mutual self interest. And use every unfair advantage including AI and crypto to make it before AGI. We need to Take the Power Back. 

Welcome to the Post Fiat Reality and best of luck with your New Year's resolutions.
