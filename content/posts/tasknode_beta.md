How and Why To Use The Task Node

I made a [ChatGPT guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-697ce68a8ec081918ecfffefa38daa10-task-node-onboarding) so you don't have to read this article 

For support join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/U6HjgDSmhR)


## Okay … What is This Thing

[The Task Node](https://tasknode.postfiat.org) - which is found at tasknode.postfiat.org -  is first and foremost a productivity tool driven by advances in Large Language Models. It’s designed to take a group of people, merge them with an AI system, to improve the group’s productivity. It pays for itself via the generation of alpha which comes from understanding the aggregate behaviors of the group. And then, as reputation and domain expertise build - explicitly querying members for alpha. It is built on an L1 cryptocurrency I am the founder of called “Post Fiat” (PFT)

I built the system originally to use AI to improve my own judgment. I found that AI makes it easy to build specific things. But it’s not good at focusing you on what’s important. So the Task Node is the product of years of personal prompt engineering. 

Rather than trying to profit by an expensive monthly subscription, the Task Node monetizes via speculation on aggregate user activity. The profits from the task node flow back to the native token of the underlying network, Post Fiat (PFT). Tasks are aggregated into an alternate data stream that informs investing decisions. You might see a list of tickers streaming in Discord associated with each task if you enable the Activity Channel updates for your account. 

Eventually if a large number of users join the Task Node - the goal is for the system to become self improving. Building out its own features / evolving to optimize network value. This aligns with the speech I gave at Token2049 in 2025 called “AI Hive Minds”. 

## The Task Node and Post Fiat 101

The Task Node is the interface to the Post Fiat Network (PFT). Post Fiat is a fork of XRP - focused on buy-side rather than sell side applications. It uses AI - namely on-chain verified inference - to replace the opaque human driven consensus process of XRP with a fair, transparent and programmatic system.

When you create an account on the Task Node, you also create a Post Fiat Wallet and get a seed phrase. Do not lose this seed phrase. The Task Node app itself 

Right now the Task Node is the best way to qualify for future Post Fiat (PFT) airdrops. It's running on a testnet currently and when you click transactions and go to a block explorer, those are live along with balances. 

The system is designed to deal with the big problem with AI agents. It’s very easy to understand how to work, and to build things. It’s less clear how to use AI to improve what you are working on. And even harder to coordinate with a group. 

The Task Node puts structure around task generation so that LLMs can refine:
* your overall strategy and values which inform tasks
* The selection of tasks in relation to your own goals
* The selection of your tasks in the context of the other people using the task node

Some of the social functions of the task node include:
* Profile pages which show what you are working on
* Anonymized discord updates that show your tasks as you complete them
* Automated extraction of what you’re good at and what you’re looking for to connect you to other community members
* Private messaging with payments bolted on 

Task Node activity is default encrypted. Key pieces of evidence are stored in IPFS in an encrypted format. The default sharing is with the Task Node Faucet PFT address and your own address. 

The Task Node is a primarily social experience – that is to say, you use it with other people. 

I believe you’ll find when using the task node you will enjoy:
1) Increased productivity
2) Direct airdrop rewards from completing tasks
3) Access to a flywheel where being part of a collective can contribute 

## Understanding the Data Lake and Task Node/ Post Fiat Economics 

When I worked at Palantir there was always a concept of a “Data Lake”. A shared environment where corporations could all contribute their data to a pool to get god level insights. Where the whole would be greater than the sum of the parts. In practice, this was very hard to implement. 

At Post Fiat - the Data Lake is the aggregate signal that comes from a lot of users completing tasks and contributing to the network.

This involves:
1. Their user experience using different products such as Postgres, mongoDB, google search or even hotel bookings, flight bookings etc 
2. Their expertise in their actual career - accessible to the system in an expert network style

To those of you unfamiliar with expert networks - they are common mechanisms for hedge fund professionals to ask questions from experts about the key equity investments they have.

Thus there are two parts of the data lake:
1. Aggregation users completing personal or network tasks use tools and products that are associated with tickers. The system aggregates timeseris of usage to inform long and short signals in associated securities. For example - if a large cohort of MongoDB power users churn, using the Task Node - the system may place a short position on MongoDB
2. Expert Network. Once a user has defined themselves through their task completion as a vetted expert they can contribute “alpha requests”. The LLM will ask you information that can enhance buy/sell decisions the system is making relevant to your expertise, much as a hedge fund analyst would ask a domain expert for channel checks

As the data lake grows - there is a third element that is under development, namely the amplification of narrative. As unique research is assembled by the Task Node – content will be created and published, originally on my own X account but eventually routed to specific individuals with strong social followings. 

This will improve the marketplace of ideas regarding various assets. The Task Node’s on chain nature duals as a compliance mechanism to ensure that all of this activity is auditable, with timestamps and on-chain hashes, and above board. 

## The Specific UX Components of the Task Node

The basic flow of the Task Node Is:
1. Set your values, strategies and tactics (Roughly) in the Context page
2. Go into Task Chat and request tasks
3. Go onto dashboard to advance the plot of tasks (including refusing them) ultimately receiving PFT rewards
4. Sweep your PFT out of the Task Node if you want on the dashboard
5. Send messages to other users in the message tab
6. Determine whether or not you want to have your anonymized tasks render in the activity channel 
7. Publish your profile 

### Login

When you first login you will be asked for X or Github oauth. This will just read your public activity on X or Github (not write). 

If you have a new X or Github account you might not be allowed to sign up due to sybil concerns. If so, please DM me in our Discord with an explanation of why you’d like to use the Task Node and a bit about yourself (a CV/ or LinkedIn link would be helpful in this regard)

Be careful to store your seed phrase (a 24 word phrase). This backup phrase will allow you to reinstate your wallet 

As soon as you have an X or Github account Linked you will receive a 12 PFT airdrop. 

### Dashboard

Here you can send or receive PFT, manage your wallets. manage your transactions and see your outstanding, verified, refused and rewarded tasks. 

How the Task Flow works
1. Go to Task Chat
2. Discuss a Task
3. Request a Task
4. Accept a Task
5. Task appears in your Dashboard in Outstanding
6. Click an Outstanding task and Submit Evidence
7. Task moves into verification phase
8. Verification requests more evidence
9. You submit the evidence response 
10. You are rewarded 

This flow occurs in the dashboard. When you pop out tasks you should see whether a task is classified as “personal”, “network” or “alpha” along with a Task ID. If you click Task ID you will see task forensics that help you understand the history of the task 

### Context
You set your context and upload an encrypted version to IPFS. This context ought to include your high level value, strategy and tactics. 

A value is something that you want for its own sake. Something that motivates you at a high level. A strategy is how you plan on reaching your value. Your tactics are the specific actions you need to take to advance your strategy. 

Click Context Advice in order to get a specific recommendation to improve your context document. This can be slow but is well worth it as getting your strategy is important before you begin execution

### Settings
See your active wallet and linked accounts (Github and X)

Go here if you need to backup your recovery phrase for your Post Fiat account or restore your wallet. This is the place where you can turn off your sharing with the Post Fiat activity channel

You can also delete your account here. When you delete your account we also delete your data so be careful with this function 

### Manage Wallets

You can have multiple wallets associated with the Task Node. One of these wallets is “Active” and you can change which wallet you are working on here. You can also add a wallet to the list via restoration via recovery phrases 

### Task Chat

Task Chat is the home of all the major chat functions in Post Fiat. Here is a brief description of each. 

The Task Chat function guide is 

Reward generating functions - Task Discussion and Request:
* Alpha - add expert advice to the network
* Network - directly advance Post Fiat objectives
* Personal - move your objectives forward while qualifying your expertise
* Non Reward Discussion functions
** Brainstorming – deal with unknown unknowns 
** Motivation – improve your resolve
** ODV – have a confrontational thought partner 
** Clarity - Post Fiat – learn more about Post Fiat
** Clarity - App – Learn more about the specifics of the app given your context

Task Chat always knows the entirety of your:
context document
recent chat history
task rewards and verification 

#### Personal Tasks

Personal tasks are things you are working on from your own context that advance your own set strategies and values. You discuss with the Task Node what to work on and then request a task once you’re locked in 

#### Network Tasks
Network tasks pull Post Fiat’s product document and guide your specific capabilities towards advancing the network’s aims. If you’re technical that could mean open source contribution. If you’re not - it could mean marketing. Your personal tasks load into network tasks 

Your discussion can clarify what’s on roadmap and how your goals align with it then you request a network task when you’re ready for your task acceptance card

#### Alpha Tasks

Alpha tasks treat you as an operator in an expert network. This only works once you’ve vetted yourself via completing some personal tasks. There is a compliance framework that requires you to verify that you’re not submitting MNPI or violating employee agreements. 

Alpha Tasks will likely receive future airdrops based on their accuracy (not just original submission). 

#### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a mechanism that pulls in all your task, context document history and helps you navigate unknown unknowns.

#### Motivation

Motivation applies motivational frameworks to your specific circumstance in order to help you get out of a rut or to execute faster and more efficiently

#### ODV

ODV is the result of a large amount of prompt engineering and combines trial/error to make LLMs provide authoritative, well reasoned advice that is contrarian to the User’s preferences. ODV is not a yes man - it’s programmed to say whatever it takes to make you succeed. 

#### Clarity Post Fiat

This allows you to ask questions about what Post Fiat is and why it’s valuable

#### Clarity App

This is an internal guide to help you with the app

### Messages

You start by publishing a key to the PFT network. This is a public encryption key that allows you to interact with other wallets. Once you have another user’s address you can add them to your contact list and send them messages with PFT attached. Private messages are encrypted only between you and the other user. 

### Profile

The profile page has two components. Private and public

#### Public Profile

When you complete tasks you become associated with certain tickers. These are things that feed the alpha machine - but can also be useful mapping you to other users working on similar projects. Likewise, your capabilities and expert knowledge are shown on the public profile page. 

You see a sybil score (which is decomposed by how many real accounts you’ve linked, how many times you’ve tried to sybil the task node, and how many accounts you’re messaging) as well as a real time feed of your rewards

#### Private Profile

Your private profile has your Linked Wallets and which one you want to be visible on your profile page. It also contains some useful debug information for while we are in beta such as what’s feeding your task generation as well as the most recent runs for your profile pages
