Starting to wear down. Promised myself to write about the Post Fiat journey every day.

What am I supposed to say? Don't know really. 

Being a founder can be tough but nobody really gives a fuck about that. Everyone has their own problems and probably think my life is easy. 

People always want some kind of cheerleader figure who looks good. Bc they want a role model bc secretly they know society is fucked

it actually really pisses me off. I'll talk about all this impactful stuff that matters to me and 90% of the comments are about my personal appearance. Like lockstep. (talks for 30 minutes about some topic I did a ton of reseasrch on). "What's your skincare routine bro?" And it's not just me, it's literally every informative video on the internet

There's this insane video of the Tik Tok founder talking about his Joker moment. He was running an education app. And he was running out of money. Standing on a train. And realized everyone on the train was scrolling on their phones. And not one person wanted to learn something. That's when he hard pivoted into Tik Tok. Because he understood viscerally: people don't want to learn. The rest is history. 

saw this article today on Reddit about a bunch of boomers in the hospitals and they're glued to these charismatic facebook video life coaches. one guy's wife was trying to spend time with him and he wouldn't pay attention to her bc he was too absorbed in the video. He literally died watching it. pretty much sums it all up. 

But don't get trapped in delusion. The world is the way it is. And the job is just to see as clearly as possible, identify an edge other people are unwilling to consider and full court press. most ppl are too proud to do it, at the end of the day. they'd rather live in self constructed cocoons where Trump isn't president, where Crime isn't legal, where the supply of the currency isn't fucking infinite, and where human intelligence isn't on the verge of a full scale extinction event due to AI 

my health is always fluctuating. I work so much it's really hard to keep strength/ speed levels up to snuff. "Bro you gotta put your health first"

yea - well fun fact. did you know the top 1% of society gains more health benefit from money than the combined effects of diet, exercise and genetics due to superior medical care. making post fiat token go up is probably the most direct correlation btwn my long term health outcomes 

at least that's the cope. face is swollen/ not getting enough rest. stopped tracking HRV bc I don't want to see things going off a cliff mentally 

but the reality is that the token is somewhat an extension of me so I need to invest in personal trainers or whatever the fuck the audience wants. Self aware Andrew Tate

It's too hard to get a solid workout in at home. I have literally zero time. Tend to wake up 5:30 am and go to bed 9:45 with a 15 minute wind down, eat in front of my screen. What's taking time?
1. Fundraising meetings - I probably shouldn't have taken. Especially given my desire to sell tokens is low. But whatever, some of them were valuable
2. Hiring. Interviewed a ton of people. Most did not hire. Hired too aggressively early on and not making that mistake again.
3. Bank workflows
4. Fixing the task node
5. Building the framework for the ETF / AI trading strategies related to the bank workflows 
6. Kicking the tires on the UNL selection formulas
7. web design/ deck design
8. compliance interviews w both customer, and now Bloomberg who is provisioning a chat tool 
9. Talking to KOLs who will likely affect post fiat token price
10. Administrative stuff 

My old job used to be:
1. Trading

haha. 

But I did this for a reason. Post Fiat is the only way to generate a multi billion dollar outcome. Nobody said it would be easy. I think something I need to remind myself: The game is the game. People hate that XRP even exists. People hate that BTC even exists. And they're sidelined, and permanently fcked.

If you hate that your audience is comprised of ppl who don't give a sht about what you say, and just want to scroll slop. Too fucking bad. Your job is to deliver them what they want. People would rather watch content than spend time with their love ones before they die. Who the fck are you to deprive the market of its preferences?

So buckle down. Hit the gym. Get a tripod. Do interval training. Eat the goop. Track your sleep score. Vibe code. Go to conferences. Buy a suit. Do the Spaces. 

DO NOT:
1. Think you're better than anyone
2. Think you're going to change the world
3. Try to fix anything

You are in the business of making a crytographic liferaft and then making the price of that liferaft correlate with the rise of superintelligence and the collapse of the debt based monetary system. Pride is for the foolish and the dead. 

There are 4 more years at most where any of this matters so the most important thing is being willing to go all the way

Mindset: if you went on CNBC to talk about Post Fiat how many people would buy it after watching you?
