What is my job?

An entrepreneur makes a product to sell. The job of someone building a cryptocurrency is building something they do not want to sell. 

Selling is a dispersement of belief 

"Believe in something." is the wrong frame. Your job is to believe in 1 thing because otherwise you would sell that 1 thing and buy many things. Diversification is selling. 

My job is to build something I do not want to sell. 

It is to recognize correctly that Fiat currency is a control mechanism meant to keep you in debt and brain washed. 

People who sell - in this respect, are part of the system. They are people who willfully accept servitude in exchange for baubles and scratches behind the ears from society's masters. 

When you sell, it is important to recognize who you are selling to. The elite, who control you with the products that you buy with your sales

By selling you are acknowledging and capitalizing their power and dissipating your own. Selling is a "reward" but at the cost of indication of belief. It is a bending of the knee

The only acceptable sale is to accelerate building the thing you do not want to sell. You part with network supply in an extremely stingy manner. You work for network supply. You control the supply aggressively out of a natural disdain for people masquerading as believers in order to get their short term treats. 

Intention is important. Sales must be not for consumption but for building. 

But what is worth not selling? A Bitcoin, for example, is mindless. It can not say anything. It has no agency. 

The idea of holding it forever, or holding Gold forever is unsatisfying. Would you marry a woman who you could never interact with? 

Existing crypto assets are worthy rejections of an unworthy system, but after the thrill of rebellion dissipates. You are left with an empty husk. A celebration of scarcity and silence rather than a celebration of life

Useful, but morbid. Only interesting because of the community that forms around the rejection of the society that spawned it.

It is important to understand that  rigidity is the origin of Fiat currency. The austerity and ultimate cruelty of the Gold standard was undesirable - as society wanted currency that evolved with the economy's fluctuations and its technology. 

A return Pre Fiat is a regression. Devolution. 

A currency that would be worth holding must therefore itself contain evolutionary attributes. Prior to artificial intelligence it was unclear how these evolutionary attributes would manifest. Previously these evolutionary systems were downstream from government, and as we can see - these systems become corrupted and periodically collapse

As George Soros said, "In my study of markets it is clear that they do not trend towards equilibrium. This is the exception, not the rule. Rather - history has shown time and time again - that markets natural tendency is to trend towards their own destruction"

Ultimately, markets collapse because of reflexivity. Quantum distortion between regulators watching the markets - such as the Fed - and the markets themselves watching the regulators. As economies become more politicized this reflexive loop goes from a quiet hum to a screeching microphone feedback that collapses in on itself 

Thus - the evolutionary attribute of markets and society - biased politicians, who are so easily corruptible by the systems they regulate. Are ultimately encapsulations of authority. That inevitably collapse. Over and over again. 

They can do nothing *but* collapse because this feedback loop was rooted in Original Sin. Human frailty. And proclivity to let judgment be influenced by money and bribes. And this susceptibility to bribery ultimately makes the money itself worthless because it is controlled by imperfect humans 

The rise of artificial intelligence changes this fundamentally. Economic systems can be designed to regulate themselves, algorithmically without human judgment. Bitcoin was scarcity without trust. AI allows judgment without trust. 

The powerful trait of LLMs is to converge deterministically and quantitatively on qualitative judgments that previously only could have been made by judges, juries, democracies, or authoritarians. This attribute allows them to deliver verifiable judgment. Without bribery 

And more importantly - much as good judgment evolves over time. Much as wisdom grows over years. So too must the systems that administer this judgment. And thus the steady march of technological progress that makes the AI systems ever stronger will result in ever better judgment

Which is the opposite of what we see in our own societies. Where debt, reflexivity, and self dealing come to dominate before collapse after collapse 

The screeching feedback loop that permanently destroyed every economic system in human history - can finally be silenced. 

The problem is Reflexivity. The solution is AI. 

The problem is Soros. The solution is Elon.

The parallels are obvious to those who choose to see. 

By building a network capable of deterministic, non human judgment that can route economic output and decisions seamlessly -- a new system of currency can be made. That is evolutionary - instead of static and silent. Not just a store of value. But an evolution of value. 

It's not belief. But rather an acceptance that our flaws, and our beliefs have destroyed us time and time again. That the digital panopticon we live in makes it all worse with a faster cycle time.  

Rather than moving backwards to scarcity, it is better to move forward towards evolution. For the answer to the question, "What could I build that I would not want to sell?" must ultimately converge on an intelligent being greater than I am - that I trust more than I trust my politicians or even myself. 

Where after you built it, your life would become permanently better for not having sold. That is the goal.
