## The only market neutral 12x nobody understands

Since 2021, $1 invested in Nvidia and short ARKK continuously rebalanced would be worth about $12 today with little market or tech exposure. ARKK investments failed to capture the entire AI boom.

This article details the logical extension of this trend. A new economic primitive called an Agentic Protocol, which is an AI driven cryptocurrency with cash flows that accrue to its holders. 

The rise of AI Agents like Devin as well as new [open source equivalents](https://x.com/jyangballin/status/1775114444370051582) that show promise re: directly replacing engineering teams make this inevitable. Google's recent bid for Hubspot similarly indicates a desire to automate sales reps and online lead generation. Agentic Protocols are a way to think about a company with no sales or engineering team, and eventually - no people. 

Agentic Protocols are 100% of my focus (I am building one and investing in their rails). And because nobody knows what they are I thought it would be worth taking some time articulating them.

Nvidia has trounced ARKK - fundamentally because - the vast majority of normal companies including in the tech sector do not really benefit from AI. 

Even though AI has 12x-ed vs "AI beneficiaries" - people continue to argue and position themselves for the opposite. That mysteriously, the companies in Cathie Wood’s dumpster fire of a portfolio just haven’t benefited from AI yet. But for some reason, they will soon. The AI industry, and even its chat bots are economically aligned to spread this narrative - because the alternative, that AI does not broadly benefit society - will almost certainly incite industry regulation.  

Though ARKK is easy to pick on, it is representative of an entire school of thought - and backed by Tiger Cub, Bill Hwang (who lost all of his own money instead of investors). Thus its underperformance points to a broader failure to recognize that AI does not actually benefit the "innovation economy" - that instead, it replaces it. It's an important asset - not just due to its liquidity and publicity, but because it is a benchmark for IPO valuations and an entire much larger asset class (venture capital). 

Everyone had the wrong bet. Prices have 12x-ed in their faces. And yet the "AI beneficiary" proponents continue to spread their gospel, and collect hundreds of millions of fees annually fleecing retail investors. 

The "innovation" economy they're selling is all about promising future growth. Future revenue. Billings curves. And so on. Whereas AI companies are delivering in the here and now - which is precisely why the future predictors failed to buy them. Thus - the first crash in 2022 was rates driven - because the discount rate which allowed that future to be imagine increased, and that future became less valuable. But AI stocks have risen in spite of rates - because they are delivering on a 1-3 year time frame, not a 10 year timeframe like the innovation economy. Long Nvidia and Short ARKK realizes a .23 correlation to rates - demonstrating this. 

Thinking of duration another way - anyone working on AI applications naturally understands how absurd it is to forecast even 2 years out. Whereas Cathie Wood and other "Innovation economy" or "AI beneficiary" proponents claim insight into the next 5 years even though they made no money over the last 5. 

It is somewhat ironic that ARKK is one of the largest advocates for crypto. The huge surge in the cryptocurrency market will hyper accelerate the decline of the innnovation economy by allowing AI agents to access compute and storage resources without censorship by interacting with a whole new set of crypto AI primitives that have surged in value over the past year. The irony comes from the notion that if Bitcoin does actually go to Cathie Wood's price target of $3.2 million - in that world, Agentic Protocols have eaten the lunch of every single company in her portfolio. 

Agentic Protocols are only possible because of the crypto and the ability to access AI primitives directly without a cloud intermediary such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. So far - protocols such as Render have deployed huge compute resources without many users. Similarly, protocols such as IONet are enabling cheap and extremely efficient AI calculation on chain without interacting with big tech. Agentic Protocols will use the capacity.

At their core - Agentic Protocols - are a bet that AIs do tasks better than people. That they can buy the compute to do these tasks cheaply via distributed protocols. They can sell their work in a native currency that is hard to shut down. And can use the profits to improve themselves and progressively eat the real economy. 

## Short Humans and Long AI

### What is An Agentic Protocol 

Nvidia surging while the so-called innovation economy collapses is where we are now, and where we have been for the last 12 months. But the hyper up-move of Bitcoin, and Crypto AI as well as the onslaught of new AI agent technologies is bringing us to where the puck is headed over the next 12 months. 

Neither Crypto nor  trends will slow down, as people still don’t understand them and market consensus remains (per S&P and Midcap valuations) that AI will somehow flow benefits through to your average citizen. 

Nvidia will keep destroying ARKK. Cathie Wood will keep buying “AI beneficiaries” and underperforming.    

How to capitalize on this?

I’m going to spell out the vision of an Agentic Protocol

Agentic Protocols are key to understanding how exactly the “crypto AI thesis” plays out and how the dollars will flow. 

An  Agentic Protocol is a rejection of the traditional venture model, as well as the traditional crypto token model. It is - in the words of Monty Python - something completely different. 

An  Agentic Protocolis an extension of Sam Altman’s projection - that there will be a large number of two person unicorns. 

Before Getting into the Why of an Agentic Protocol I want to state what it is, outright:

An  Agentic Protocol is a self-developing AI driven entity that aims to have no human employees. It generates cash flow by licensing IP or other technology products, facilitates network economics or speculates. It has its own native cryptocurrency token which 1] is the currency by which its products are sold or licensed which 2] allows human or AI users to participate in the upside of its financial activities 3] validates and pays for the opex of the system which is primarily compute, training and storage.

### A Visualization of What Agentic Protocols Look Like 
Because Agentic Protocols are not something most people are familiar with - a quick visualization.

Imagine a set of computer programs, interacting with one another acting as digital engineers. Controlled by a product manager - an open source GPT. This manager tells them what code to write. They iteratively test the code, using compute resources they buy from crypto protocols such as IONet. They store their output using storage protocols such as Filecoin or Arweave. Then sell the outputs to either other protocols or people. 

Their products could range from actual software, to designs, to entertainment. Because Agentic Protocols are natively on chain - the rise of asset tokenization per Blackrock's recent push allows them to speculate with their treasuries, or alternatively hedge out the market risk associated with their consumption of other tokens that they need to generate their goods. 

Some Agentic Protocols will be influencer farms, others hedge funds, others on-chain arbitrageurs, others entertainment conglolmerates. 

An  Agentic Protocol rather than hiring, raising money, or focusing on optics/ IPOs focuses on the utility of its community (as well as community ownership),  and development and deployment of models that allows its financial output to be higher. 

When you boil it down - if AI valuations are right - ranging from Nvidia, to Bittensor in crypto - the all in bet to make is that AI Agents can generate huge amounts of cash flow for a very small number of owners in a way that generates broken unit economics vs human employees. 

### Structurally Higher Intelligence Margins vs Corporations 

You want to scalably harvest the value of AI application and short the prices of model deployment, and compute. I will refer to this as the term “Intelligence Margin” - which is the spread between the cost of compute and the potential revenue of compute. 

Where Agentic Protocol differ from the current framework of AI thinking: consider Accenture (which I’ve written about before as a large short position). 

Accenture argues that it can make money helping existing corporations adopt AI. That it can apply AI to clients' workflows at a profit.

If the Agentic Protocol thesis is right - if the “Innovation Economy” continues lagging behind the real AI economy - then this will not ever happen at significant scale. 

Accenture will not be able to compete with AI native applications. 

People pointing to the cloud transition analogue are wrong. “The Cloud” couldn’t interact with customers directly. The Cloud did not obsolete human intelligence.

We already talk to AI chatbots constantly, who are perfectly capable of explaining, upselling, making slide decks and recommending organizational level changes. 

Would you rather get your advice on AI architecture and adoption from an expensive guy in business casual or an AGI that is literally a physical manifestation of AI architecture?

I pick on Accenture because they are early reclassifying their revenue as AI revenue. So they will be an interesting test subject to evaluate. My prediction is that we will see vast amounts of corporations appear seemingly from nowhere that provide Accenture customers with their AI needs, or - if there are conservative entities involved (like the military), they will be served by hoodied freaks at Palantir interacting with close-to-AGI level abstractions. 

In the new nomenclature, Accenture's "Intelligence Margins" are structurally impaired compared to those commanded by Agentic Protocols. 

## Corporate Framings

Before going further into what these abstractions look like - I want to start with some framings

A traditional venture company is a speculative R&D corporation that aims to build a product people want, grow that product extremely quickly then IPO to land and expand that product

A cryptocurrency network aims to create a new way for value to get transferred that has preferable security and efficiency qualities relative to fiat money, Bitcoin, or Ethereum

A cryptocurrency token sits on top of a network and allows users of a product on a cryptocurrency network to participate in equity-like upside. Traditionally, cryptocurrency tokens inflate or print tokens to fund their operations, much like traditional venture companies issue new shares.  

A cash flow business is a non-speculative entity that delivers a low risk product - such as a coffee brand, or consulting services to a small set of customers 

At its core - an  Agentic Protocol is a mix of a Cash Flow Business and a Cryptocurrency Token. It’s a cryptocurrency that aims to use AI to generate sufficient cash flow such that its token supply is continuously decreasing for the benefit of its users, who also use the protocol in a way that generates utility for the service that it is selling. 

At its core - an Agentic Protocol is a rejection of the previous wealth model in the pre-AI era where your proximity to humans is what mattered. It is a rejection of venture. Of Wall Street. And even of crypto. 

It’s the ultimate doomer asset class. Crypto with cashflows and capital returns. 

## Hyper Deflationary Censorship Resistant Swarm of AI Powered Digital Hornets

Ethena is one of the first crypto projects that has reached astronomical valuations because it generates massive cash flows.

As geopolitical issues worsen in the Middle East, the US and China continue to accelerate their cold war, the Ukrainian theater of war shows no sign of ending - we are in a market where Gold is skyrocketing, at the same time as long bonds are rising. 

This has a dual cylinder effect - that cash flow businesses are suddenly worth more, at the same time as censorship resistance and asset fungibility is also important. This has played out historically with the BNB token surviving the taper tantrum due to its ability to generate huge cash flows and finance their business throughout a bear market. 

Thus - as rates surge - crypto tokens that generate cash flow -- suddenly will dominate the market meta. Not high flying projects that promise the world. Those are -- essentially just extensions of the failed "innoavation economy" thesis. But things that can generate profit. Not print tokens. Right here. And right now using Artificial Intelligence tools. Extracting a value called the intelligence margin. 

## Agentic Protocols Vs Standard Venture Corporations

### Thesis 

Traditional corporations are a bet on humans doing things well, and being the center of economic reality

Agentic Protocols assume that humans become less important over time - both as employees and customers. 

###  Equity structure

Traditional corporations are funded by equity offerings. 

Agentic Protocols fund themselves by token offerings and cash flows of AI applications.

### Founders

The founders of a traditional tech corporation are focused on two things: hiring, and not running out of money. 

A CTO writing code at a venture backed company is probably a sign that the company is going to fail. 

The Founder of Agentic Protocols are focused on two things: building and deploying better AI agents, and ensuring their activities pay for the compute and calculations they consume. 

An Agentic Protocol founder has to be a rockstar technical contributor and involved in day to day implementation. 

The dream of a tech founder is to be Steve Jobs

The dream of an Agentic Protocol Founder is to be Harry Seldon (a ghostlike voice who is long dead). 

### Teams

Teams at traditional companies are as big as they need to be to deliver the product 

Agentic Protocols do not let teams touch core IP. Only design agents that do. Humans at Agentic Protocols do not have equity. Agentic Protocols may license other "team models" such as Devin, or open source versions of devin from other protocols. But unlike 10x engineers - who are constrained by time in the day, a 10x digital engineer is constrained only by computational capacity so costs will be far lower. Team is still a huge time allocation of an Agentic Protocol - but it's based on improving algorithms and systems, not people.  

### Revenue Sources

Traditional tech cos tend to make money on software licensing and ad revenue 

Agentic Protocols are likely to generate funds on speculation, deployment of systematic trading, arbitraging compute and other resources across networks, bridging crypto native economic systems in profitable ways, providing low end customer support, or custom integrations for specific verticals, and creating and distributing AI based video games and interactive pornography 

In the future - as the economy becomes more and more AI based, Agentic Protocols will do business with one another in ways that are - essentially unintelligible to human analysts. The life cycle of entire industries and companies will be weeks long (look at Github development now). The entire investing paradigm in such a world would change fundamentally. Thus - treasury management will be a key 

An interesting historical analogue would be Royal Dutch Shell - [which made fortunes speculating for decades in Southeast Asia](https://www.amazon.com/Prize-Epic-Quest-Money-Power/dp/B0CVHGNZ27/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2QZEMUMUW3ZGI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TOKJ7Z6rmunQi_ru2HlTmesC72eAWPYUT9sQjjwgoCNy3cBhbg2vrKcaRziA3_D1Wnd8ZEYGoTpFVZBEodpad-3A3mqXPuVwndEwon4LI_yBtH8Ky1bLri8R1fbG_QVewyT9Vjp6sjwl1EqLeO0bVk4RM0W5sTY32CbWPevmym6IgTHaSe5RO-bFfZn20hpneQTOLJr9gjS1tQEzHYwST6bHThPti7gbceVMktXvFJ0.WSSa_6Om03Bo8TxKmSJA7WD69ToCTgmxabksF_NcA5E&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+prize&qid=1712500787&sprefix=the+prize%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-1) before finding and exploiting any real oil reserves. 

### Expenses 

Traditional corporations might spend on lawyers, share based comp for employees, cloud spend at Microsoft and Amazon

Agentic Protocols are crypto native and therefore spend funds on compute from platforms like IONet, storage/hosting from protocols like Filecoin and Arweave, or tasks from the growing array of networks providing calculation overlays (such as Render). Worldcoin will be important in an Agentic Protocol world to verify human tasks - such as customer interaction. 

### Governance and Regulation 

While traditional corporations rely heavily on boards, and traditional share issuances - Agentic protocols will resemble autonomous DAOs - where various stakeholders with protocol ownership and economic value vote to make changes to protocol that increases cash flows.

Compared to existing DAOs, which are notoriously poorly managed due to checked out human 'community managers', Agentic Protocols will be far more professionalized and resemble in "form" a more formal public company. This overhead would be prohibitively high for a human start up - but the reporting capability of a purely algorithmic entity is much higher. 

This will also provide surface area for Agentic Protocols to gain traction with regulators, as compared to other cryptocurrency protocols. Real free cash flow generating entities with public on-chain governance, and extensive reporting that have no human employees or officers and are therefore not securities are a primitive that should be more comfortable for regulators, than say - meme coins, or protocols with massive issuance entirely reliant on "pumps" for value creation

There also may be a world in which Agentic Protocols simply register as crypto securities - an idea that has been surfaced by Blackrock and others. 

The key point to get across - that as real economic entities - not scams, or memes - Agentic Protocols will gain far more traction and mindshare with traditional conservative capital markets participants. 

The final regulatory tailwind for Agentic Protocols is the ARKK adjacent SPAC boom which made a joke of US capital markets with a huge number of so called Innovation Company IPOs in 2021. Most of these companies are down over 50%, and many - including the first and most prominent (Virgin Galactic) [are down over 80%](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/features/spacs-disasters/). A sudden boom in cash flow generating technology companies with completely auditable operations would actually be a breath of fresh air from an investor protection perspective. 

### Censorship Resistance and Security Classification 

Traditional cryptocurrency networks have a problem. Crypto markets are constantly changing. For example, the Solana Blockchain has recently faced congestion that has made it unusable. Developers need to work to quickly patch the bug. Because the network requires "common enterprise" of these developers to fix the bug, it conflicts with the laws of many countries which would classify such essential bug mashing as the action of a corporation.  

This sounds trivial but is actually a huge issue for the widespread adoption of crypto. Even the ETH ETF is facing difficulty being approved - in large part because its network is still under constant development. 

Essentially the 2 problems are: 1] Network R&D results in security classification which hampers adoption 2] the people doing the R&D are the reason why sovereigns have jurisdiction. The Solana devs in NYC are why the US can claim jurisdiction enforcing any laws. 

Agentic Protocols provide a much needed solution to these structural issues. Because they have few human developers, or none - it's very hard to argue they're a common enterprise. Because they rely on distributed networks it's very difficult to even place them in one location. Over time this is a huge advantage for iterative development. 

A realistic base case is that Agentic Protocol dev shops actually become the major core developers for most Layer 1 crypto protocols - and accrue huge network rewards as a result.  

## Harvesting the Intelligence Margin

The big picture macro of Agentic Protocols is excellent. There are three big drivers of this. Sovereign friction. Declining human intelligence. Increasing cost of capital and taxation. 

### Sovereign Friction

Let's say Nvidia is right and every country ends up building their own "Sovereign AI". Their own models. And data centers.

Because we cannot predict which country will do better - but that there are accelerating gains to the country that does best - you have a situation where most Fiat corporations will be structurally impaired vs some competitor. But citizens in most countries won't have access to this competitor's products. And various firewalls will prevent superior products from being sold. 

The solution is "post sovereign AI" - which is currently being built, that daisy chains links to all the different AI systems outside of the sovereign sandboxes. Though there are some architectural inefficiencies inherent in this system (because you essentially need to use crypto protocols, which is very cumbersome) - these inefficiencies are being overcome and you can currently buy compute and storage on blockchains for cost parity or even a discount vs centralized source. 

The historical analog here would be Glencore - which harvested large profits from inefficiently linked commodity markets (which existed because of the Cold War between capitalism and communism which is now reaccelerating)

And we also know that the amount of war and conflict is constantly increasing - both due to the cold war between the US and China, but also due to the second order effects of the US withdrawing from its role as the World Policeman (which is now seeming to result in conflict in Iran and Israel). 

### Declining Human Intelligence and Birth Rates

Student test scores globally have been in free fall since COVID and have not recovered. "Global average math scores plummeted by approximately 15 points since 2018—the equivalent of three-fourths of a year of learning—but countries such as Germany, Iceland, and the Netherlands saw their PISA math scores drop by at least 25 points" - per OECD data. [Note that this is occurring](https://heytutor.com/resources/blog/student-test-scores-are-falling-across-the-world-is-the-pandemic-to-blame/#:~:text=Global%20average%20math%20scores%20plummeted,dip%20in%20average%20math%20scores.) at the zenith of so-called "digital learning" technology. 

The global TFR has more than halved over the past 70 years, from around five children for each female in 1950 to 2.2 children in 2021—with over half of all countries and territories (110 of 204) below the population replacement level of [2.1 births per female as of 2021](https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/newsroom/news-releases/lancet-dramatic-declines-global-fertility-rates-set-transform).

In April, ResumeBuilder.com surveyed 1,344 managers and business leaders and [found 74% believe GenZ is more difficult to work with](https://www.resumebuilder.com/3-in-4-managers-find-it-difficult-to-work-with-genz/) than other generations. This is a US based study but similar phenomena are [arising in Asia](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/youth-unemployment-in-china-new-metric-same-mess/#:~:text=After%20a%20six%2Dmonth%20absence,for%20December%202023%3A%2014.9%20percent.) - where a generation of youth has basically checked out from a system where it is impossible to afford a house or family. 

Tik Tok was the first major AI application and we've seen what it has done to [attention spans](https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Span-Finding-Fighting-Distraction/dp/1335449418) and work productivity. And The Tik Tok induced brain death was prior to the age of hyper-AI advancement. The age of incelibacy and declining birth rates was before mass adopted virtual reality headsets get supercharged with insanely addictive digital pornography.  

ChatGPT has been around since November 2022. And yet, Biden and Trump - two inept geriatrics, are set to be the leaders of the free world. So clearly Chatbots haven't really moved the needle on our sociopolitical intelligence. Nor will they be allowed to - for the most part, as incumbent political parties constrict their usage to retain power. 

In 12 months we are going to be wondering why corporate productivity isn’t improving. Why EPS didn’t budge that much. The dawning horror of equity markets as they realize that all the distraction. All the digital addiction. All the vices of society are not going to be "solve" by AI. They're going to be hyper amplified.

It's naiive to argue that humans are going to get smarter because of technology when technology has increased its adoption rate at the largest pace in human history and humans have become less capable and less motivated. The labor force is tight and declining. Friction to hiring has never been higher, and will continue to increase. These factors harm traditional corporations and are tailwinds to Agentic Protocols which opt instead for automation. 

### Increasing Cost of Capital and Taxation

Global debt to GDP is [above 3:1](https://www.reuters.com/business/global-debt-hits-new-record-high-313-trillion-iif-2024-02-21/#:~:text=%22Around%2055%25%20of%20this%20rise,to%20nearly%20330%25%20in%202023) and the fungibility of debt across nations is declining due to [geopolitical conflict](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/What-is-behind-the-40-drop-in-China-s-U.S.-Treasury-holdings). This lowers bond market liquidity when it is most needed. War and rising commodity costs, which are endemic to the hedgemon backing away from a role as a policeman - will further exacerbate fiscal problems. Because global wealth disparity is nearing [all time highs](https://wid.world/news-article/whats-new-about-wealth-inequality-in-the-world/#:~:text=The%202023%20update%20of%20the,inequality%20data%20up%20to%202022.&text=The%20top%2010%25%20own%20nearly,almost%20entirely%20deprived%20of%20wealth.) - it's more or less inevitable that governments act increasingly aggressively to tax the rich. Because rich command most of the capital currently and see where things are going, there will be an animal spirits bid for not just crypto - but crypto native economic models such as Agentic Protocols.

The resulting game theory will make it very difficult for any one country to agree on regulating Agentic Protocols. The only real way to put the cat back in the bag would be global agreements which will be impossible to reach while the world's 2 tech super powers are engaged in a cold war. 

But - because they'll try in a hamfisted manner, and populists will increasingly make life difficult for technologists (who will be blamed for wealth disparity) - this actually creates a virtuous cycle for the talent that Agentic Protocols do need. Visionary people will understand where things are going and want to get out of the system.

As the Utopian "Innovation Investments" fail, IPO stocks struggle, it will become increasingly clear that the venture boom was a huge mistake. Capital will flow outwards into crypto - which has further appeal in a world where people are constantly migrating from one region to another. And this capital will further subsidize Agentic Corporations, which will continue to disrupt traditional corporations, in a ruthless reflexive feedback loop. 


## Conclusion: The Railway to Freedom Is Built But The Train Only Leaves Once

The rails for Agentic Protocols are coming online. Within the next 6 months there will be 15+ major infrastructure launches in the crypto AI arena that will lower the marginal cost structure of creating Agentic Protocols to close to zero (or even negative when you incorporate airdrops). These launches are already pre-announced and most are heavily oversubscribed by crypto funds who are anxious to capitalize on the AI boom.

The resulting rails will be a subsidy to Agentic Protocols the same way that Cloud was a subsidy to B2B Saas. 

Right now everyone is thinking how to build rails, and very few people are thinking how to build cash flow machines on top of them. This is by far the most exciting thing I've seen in my career. We are talking about a multi billion dollar subsidy for maybe 60-70 actual products being built on top (at most). Imagine Amazon giving your start up a $40 million cloud credit. That's the type of tailwind that Agentic Protocols have because they're still so contrarian. 

This certainly won't happen all at once - but once again - we are so early that virtually nobody is talking about this, despite the fact we have billions of dollars of already pre-committed compute and storage subsidies coming online. Even if you bet on Agentic Protocols from a career perspective - and you're wrong, you probably end up with an extreme margin of safety because there will be such demand for AI Automation services inside traditional corporations - the entire edifice is extremely derisked. 

If you know how to code. Do you really want to build in Biden's America? Or Trumplandia? Do you want to underwrite your business's compatibility with the AOC (or insert_populist_here regime)? 

Do you want to be beholden to the cloud giants which are going to merge with the US government? Do you want to cut off your exit plan and your optionality in the age of superintelligence?

Why? To pay for Bezos yacht or absorb the fiscal deficit? 

Much as Bitcoin divorced money from the state, Agentic Protocols will divorce corporations from society. 

To protect your assets - you want to be long machine intelligence and short human intelligence. Do not make the mistake of the utopian ARKK investors of betting that machine intelligence will magically augment human productivity. There is no sign of that being true. And losers average losers.  

That is what Agentic Protocols will capitalize on. The existing trend that has caused Nvidia to 12x versus ARKK. Value will not accrue to "innovation companies" that soak shareholders overpromising 10 year visions, but instead to crypto native AI cash flow generating machines that make money today. 

Name the future so that it may come forth.
