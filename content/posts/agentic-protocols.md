## The only market neutral 12x nobody understands

Since 2021, $1 invested in Nvidia and short ARKK continuously rebalanced would be worth about $12 today with little market or tech exposure. ARKK investments failed to capture the entire AI boom.

This article details - what I think is the logical extension of this trend. A new economic primitive called an Agentic Protocol, which is an AI driven cryptocurrency with cash flows that accrue to its holders. 

The rise of AI Agents like Devin as well as new [open source equivalents](https://x.com/jyangballin/status/1775114444370051582) that show promise re: directly replacing engineering teams make this inevitable, in my view. Agentic Protocols are 100% of my focus (I am building one and investing in their rails). And because nobody knows what they are I thought it would be worth taking some time articulating them.   

ARKK failed vs Nvidia - fundamentally because - the vast majority of normal companies including in the tech sector do not really benefit from AI. 

Even though this thesis has 12x-ed - people continue to argue the opposite. That mysteriously, the companies in Cathie Wood’s dumpster fire of a portfolio just haven’t benefited from AI yet. But for some reason, they will soon. 

It’s not just security selection. Cathie Wood’s portfolio is more or less perfectly correlated with recent IPO portfolios, or public portfolios of large tech focused investment firms that have large venture arms. 

Everyone had the wrong bet - that there would be “high beta” beneficiaries of AI. And that the benefits wouldn’t flow primarily to incumbents. 

Zooming out and vastly simplifying - this is because AI is real and delivering NOW, while the 2021 bull market was fake and promising to deliver in the FUTURE. Long term interest rates are rising and only accelerating the current promise of AI corporations at the expense of the overpromisers. 

There is alpha still in the crypto AI thesis because people are still clinging to the clearly wrong “AI beneficiary” narrative rather than what seems very clearly to be base reality.

What I will outline below is basically how to go leveraged long AI beneficiaries continuing to suck, but AI continuing to work. 

## Getting Mega Short Humans and Long AI: Agentic Protocols 

Nvidia surging while the so-called innovation economy collapses is where we are now, and where we have been for the last 12 months. But the hyper up-move of Bitcoin, and Crypto AI as well as the onslaught of new AI agent technologies is bringing us to the next 12 months.

I fundamentally think neither of these trends will slow down, as people still don’t understand them and market consensus remains (per S&P and Midcap valuations) that AI will somehow flow benefits through to your average citizen. 

Nvidia will keep destroying ARKK. Cathie Wood will keep buying “AI beneficiaries” and underperforming.    

How to capitalize on this?

I’m going to spell out the vision of an Agentic Protocol

Agentic Protocols are key to understanding how exactly the “crypto AI thesis” plays out and how the dollars will flow. 

An  Agentic Protocol is a rejection of the traditional venture model, as well as the traditional crypto token model. It is - in the words of Monty Python - something completely different. 

An  Agentic Protocolis an extension of Sam Altman’s projection - that there will be a large number of two person unicorns. 

Before Getting into the Why of an Agentic Corporation I want to state what it is, outright:

An  Agentic Protocol is a self-developing AI driven entity that aims to have no human employees. It generates cash flow by licensing IP or other technology products, facilitates network economics or speculates. It has its own native cryptocurrency token which 1] is the currency by which its products are sold or licensed which 2] allows human or AI users to participate in the upside of its financial activities 3] validates and pays for the opex of the system which is primarily compute, training and storage.

An  Agentic Protocol rather than hiring, raising money, or focusing on optics/ IPOs focuses on the utility of its community (as well as community ownership),  and development and deployment of models that allows its financial output to be higher. 

When you boil it down - if AI valuations are right - ranging from Nvidia, to Bittensor in crypto - the all in bet to make is that AI Agents can generate huge amounts of cash flow for a very small number of owners in a way that generates broken unit economics vs human employees. 

You want to scalably harvest the value of AI application and short the prices of model deployment, and compute. I will refer to this as the term “Intelligence Margin” - which is the spread between the cost of compute and the potential revenue of compute. 

Where  Agentic Protocol differ from the current framework of AI thinking: consider Accenture (which I’ve written about before as a large short position). 

Accenture argues that it can make money helping existing corporations adopt AI. That it can apply AI to clients' workflows at a profit.

If the Agentic Protocol thesis is right - if the “Innovation Economy” continues lagging behind the real AI economy - then this will not ever happen at significant scale. 

Accenture will not be able to compete with AI native applications. 

People pointing to the cloud transition analogue are wrong. “The Cloud” couldn’t interact with customers directly. The Cloud did not obsolete human intelligence.

We already talk to AI chatbots constantly, who are perfectly capable of explaining, upselling, making slide decks and recommending organizational level changes. 

Would you rather get your advice on AI architecture and adoption from an expensive guy in business casual or an AGI that is literally a physical manifestation of AI architecture?

I pick on Accenture because they are early reclassifying their revenue as AI revenue. So they will be an interesting test subject to evaluate. My prediction is that we will see vast amounts of corporations appear seemingly from nowhere that provide Accenture customers with their AI needs, or - if there are conservative entities involved (like the military), they will be served by hoodied freaks at Palantir interacting with close-to-AGI level abstractions. 

## Corporate Framings

Before going further into what these abstractions look like - I want to start with some framings

A traditional venture company is a speculative R&D corporation that aims to build a product people want, grow that product extremely quickly then IPO to land and expand that product

A cryptocurrency network aims to create a new way for value to get transferred that has preferable security and efficiency qualities relative to fiat money, Bitcoin, or Ethereum

A cryptocurrency token sits on top of a network and allows users of a product on a cryptocurrency network to participate in equity-like upside. Traditionally, cryptocurrency tokens inflate or print tokens to fund their operations, much like traditional venture companies issue new shares.  

A cash flow business is a non-speculative entity that delivers a low risk product - such as a coffee brand, or consulting services to a small set of customers 

At its core - an  Agentic Protocol is a mix of a Cash Flow Business and a Cryptocurrency Token. It’s a cryptocurrency that aims to use AI to generate sufficient cash flow such that its token supply is continuously increasing for the benefit of its users, who also use the protocol in a way that generates utility for the service that it is selling. 

At its core - an Agentic Protocol is a rejection of the previous wealth model in the pre-AI era where your proximity to humans is what mattered. It is a rejection of venture. Of Wall Street. And even of crypto.

It’s the ultimate doomer asset class. Crypto with cashflows. 

## Hyper Deflationary Censorship Resistant Swarm of AI Powered Digital Hornets

Ethena is one of the first crypto projects that has reached astronomical valuations because its protocol generates massive cash flows.

As geopolitical issues worsen in the Middle East, the US and China continue to accelerate their cold war, the Ukrainian theater of war shows no sign of ending - we are in a market where Gold is skyrocketing, at the same time as long bonds are rising. 

This has a dual cylinder effect - that cash flow businesses are suddenly worth more, at the same time as censorship resistance and asset fungibility is also important. This has played out historically with the BNB token surviving the taper tantrum due to its ability to generate huge cash flows and finance their business throughout a bear market. 

Thus - as rates surge - crypto tokens that generate cash flow -- suddenly will dominate the market meta. Not high flying projects that promise the world. But things that can generate profit. Not print tokens. Right here. And right now using Artificial Intelligence tools. 

## Agentic Protocols Vs Standard Venture Corporations

### Thesis 

Traditional corporations are a bet on humans doing things well, and being the center of economic reality

Agentic Protocols assume that humans become less important over time - both as employees and customers. 

###  Equity structure

Traditional corporations are funded by equity offerings. 

Agentic Protocols fund themselves by token offerings and cash flows of AI applications.

### Founders

The founders of a traditional tech corporation are focused on two things: hiring, and not running out of money. 

A CTO writing code at a venture backed company is probably a sign that the company is going to fail. 

The Founder of Agentic Protocols are focused on two things: building and deploying better AI agents, and ensuring their activities pay for the compute and calculations they consume. 

An Agentic Protocol founder has to be a rockstar technical contributor and involved in day to day implementation. 

The dream of a tech founder is to be Steve Jobs

The dream of an Agentic Protocol Founder is to be Harry Seldon (a ghostlike voice who is long dead). 

Indeed - the most valuable Agentic protocols will not longer be corporations. 

### Teams

Teams at traditional companies are as big as they need to be to 

Agentic Protocols do not let teams touch core IP. Only design agents that do. Humans at Agentic Protocols do not have equity 

At first the founder has access to the IP but over time that is transitioned to a foundation. 

### Revenue Sources

Traditional tech cos tend to make money on software licensing and ad revenue 

Agentic Protocols are likely to generate funds on speculation, deployment of systematic trading, arbitraging compute and other resources across networks, bridging crypto native economic systems in profitable ways, providing low end customer support, or custom integrations for specific verticals, and creating and distributing AI based video games and interactive pornography 

### Expenses 

Traditional corporations might spend on lawyers, share based comp for employees, cloud spend at Microsoft and Amazon

Agentic Protocols are crypto native and therefore spend funds on compute from platforms like IONet, storage/hosting from protocols like Filecoin and Arweave, or tasks from the growing array of networks providing calculation overlays (such as Render). Worldcoin will be important in an Agentic Protocol world to verify human tasks - such as customer interaction. 

## Conclusion: The Railway to Freedom Is Built But The Train Only Leaves Once

The rails are built. Within the next 6 months there will be 15+ major infrastructure launches in the crypto AI arena that will lower the marginal cost structure of creating agentic corporations to close to zero (or even negative when you incorporate airdrops).

If you’re a millennial like me. And you know how to code. Do you really want to build in Biden’s America? Do you want to be beholden to the cloud giants who are going to merge with the US government? Do you want to cut off your exit plan and your optionality in the age of superintelligence?

Why? To pay for Bezos yacht or pump the boomers 401ks? 

In 12 months we are going to be wondering why corporate productivity isn’t improving. Why EPS didn’t budge that much. The dawning horror of equity markets as they realize that all the distraction. All the digital addiction. All the vices of society are going to be hyper amplified by AI. 

The Tik Tok induced brain death was prior to the age of hyper-AI. The age of incelibacy and declining birth rates was before mass adopted virtual reality headsets get supercharged with insanely addictive digital pornography.  

You do NOT want to be long humans getting smarter because of AI. The savvy and the cynical will bet on them getting less functional. But harvest the financial upside of the real trend - that the gap between AI intelligence and human intelligence will be increasing exponentially for the next decade. 

That is what Agentic Protocols will do. Crypto native AI cash flow generating machines. 

Name the future so that it may come forth.
