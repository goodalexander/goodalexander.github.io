Thinking about best risk reward opportunities


## General Market Take

The week got started out with god awful Japanese data, and the drumbeat of war in eastern Europe. Given absurd dovishness of Central Banks and the fact Lagarde will be speaking all weak (she is going to be dovish) - it's going to be hard to see the rate hike narrative last in spite of extreme inflation. This is obviously an explosive combination given the fact inflation is likely to be well above the 5% target throughout much of 2022, a clear legal violation of the Fed's mandate. But that is a problem for tomorrow. This week, should be a major pump. Further lockdowns should buouy risk assets further as Lagarde will cite down Austrian police state measures as a justification to print even more despite inflation. 

Russia going to war should be on the margin bearish for gold, as it will exhaust Russian gold reserves. It should also be quite bullish for the US Energy Sector. Parabolic rises in food prices globally also have me interested in the food sector, especially Nutrien. Can see cooperation on Monday evening between Biden and Xi to fight inflation and talk about Climate. The animal spirits sales at Single's Day in China make China the clear and abrupt bright spot versus Europe - which given the Evergrande headline flows should be supportive of a narrative change. Also worth noting German exports surprised rather dismally last week while Chinese Exports surprised to the upside.

The big question on my mind right now is this "Pfizer Pill" and the extent to which the market weights it versus Austrian lockdowns. Logically a 90% reduction in death should bring Covid mortality in line with the flu. Marc Benioff essentially Tweeted that Covid was cancelled. Politicians absolutely have every incentive to pretend that the Pfizer Pill doesn't work in order to cement further power / print more $ / do more spending bills. But with tanking approval ratings, Biden might need to celebrate the Pill as the solution and reopen. 

This skews risk reward more in favor of the food and energy commodity names which should face double power

## Force Rank of Sectors

Overall - technology continues to have the best overall fundamentals.  Just for example, the Nasdaq has a 2.6% free cash flow yield compared to the discretionary sector with only a 1.8% fcf yield. Z score of aggregate net income for the tech sector is .8 std vs flat for discretionary. 

Utilities (XLU)
Real Estate (XLRE)
Staples (XLP)
Discretionary (XLY)
Industrilal (XLI)
Fangs (FNGU)
Financials (XLF)
S&P (SPY)
Energy (XLE)
Dow (DIA)
Tech (XLK)
Healthcare (XLV)

TO DO ON SECTORS: need to add IWM, IJH into scoring framework. sloppy sloppy

## Overall Bitcoin / ETH Signals

Very bullish on Bitcoin overall. ETF flows should continue to be price support for asset (yes, even w modest spot etf disappointment). Crazed Tether printing should keep price up. Modestly bullish on eth quantitatively. Qualitatively, much more bullish on Bitcoin due to Taproot upgrade coming, lightning network calendar etc. Think ETH is a funding trade above 50% APY with shitcoin longs. 


Have a bullish bias on these names due to trend, data tracking, internal data.
